"Flattr supports both static buttons and javascript buttons. This directive "
"only creates dynamic javascript buttons. If you want to insert a static "
"Flattr button, you can simply copy the html code for it from Flattr, "
"instead.  Note that this directive inserts javascript code into the page, "
"that loads more javascript code from Flattr.com. So only use it if you feel "
"comfortable with that."

"The directive can be used to display a button for a thing you have already "
"manually submitted to Flattr. In this mode, the only parameter you need to "

"is the Flattr button for ikiwiki. Feel free to add it to all your pages. ;)"
