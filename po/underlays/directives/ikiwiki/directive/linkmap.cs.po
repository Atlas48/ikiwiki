"`height`, `width` - Limit the size of the map to a given height and width, "

"`connected` - Controls whether to include pages on the map that link to no "

"For best results, only a small set of pages should be mapped, since "
"otherwise the map can become very large, unwieldy, and complicated.  If too "
"many pages are included, the map may get so large that graphviz cannot "
"render it. Using the `connected` parameter is a good way to prune out pages "
"that clutter the map."
