ikiwiki (1.5) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Add --timeformat config option to allow changing how dates are displayed.
    Note that as a side effect, dates will now be displayed using the local
    timezone, not as GMT.
  * More security review.

ikiwiki (1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Tell HTML::Scrubber to treat "/" as a valid attribute which is its
    very strange way of enabling proper XHTML <br /> type tags. Output html
    should be always valid again now.
  * The page name and parent links has switched from using a <h1> to a styled
    <span>, so pages can use <h1> internally instead of needing to use <h2>.
  * Updated all of ikiwiki's own wiki pages for that.
  * Add pagetemplate hook, which can be used by plugins that want to mess
    around with adding new stuff to the page template.
  * Remove headercontent; the search plugin now adds the search box to the
    header by registering a pagetemplate hook, and other plugins should do
    similarly.
  * Rebuilding on upgrade to this version is recommended.
  * Add a html validity check to the test suite, using the wdg-html-validator,
    if available.
  * Make the html valid when there is nothing in the actions list.
  * Reordered some function call parameters for consistency.
  * Enable full utf-8 support for page input and output.
  * Add a workaround for markdown, which does not work well with utf-8
    strings.
  * --getctime had bitrotted (well I only ever used it the once so far..),
    fix and make it a bit more flexible
  * rcs_getctime is changed, now rather than needing to loop over all pages,
    it should just use the rcs to get the ctime of the passed file.
  * When inlining a page in another one, links from the inlined page are now
    expanded the same as they are when rendering the inlined page as a
    standalone page. So rather than being expanded from the POV of the
    inlining page, they are expanded from the POV of the inlined page.

    For example, a link from blog/foo to "bar" will now link to blog/bar
    if it exists. Previously this needed to be a link explicitly to
    "blog/bar"; such links will also continue to work.

    (This was slightly complex to do as the link still has to be constructed
    relative to the inlining page.)
  * Make page edit textarea resize to fit browser window.
  * Add -refresh option to ikiwiki-mass-rebuild and use that on upgrades that
    do not need a full rebuild, in order to update any basewiki pages.

ikiwiki (1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rename inlinepage to depends, so that it can be used to refer to more
    dependency relationships than just inlining. This will require a rebuild
    on upgrade to this version.
  * Move the rss link, put it in the blogpost form if there is one and at the
    top if not. This is both nicer because easier to find, and it cleans up
    the code which had used inlinepage as a flag for adding the link later.
  * Allow the depends GlobList to be built up from multiple sources (such as
    plugins) during a page render.
  * Which means that more than one blog is now supported to appear on a
    single page. (With some limitations, like only the last one getting an
    rss file.)
  * Added a plugin system.
  * Added a pagecount plugin, enabled by default.
  * Support PreProcessorDirectives with no parameters, ie "[[pagecount ]]".
  * Fixed/optimised backlinks code, to avoid rebuilding pages to update
    backlinks when the backlinks hadn't really changed.
  * Moved inline page support, rss generation etc into the inline plugin,
    enabled by default.
  * Added brokenlinks plugin, not enabled by default, but rather handy.
  * Fix several broken links in the doc wiki.
  * Smarter behavior when creating a page and a page of the same name (but
    different location) already exists.
  * Add an orphans plugin for finding pages that nothing links to.
  * Removed backlinks page, which it turns out nothing used.
  * Split off an IkiWiki.pm out of ikiwiki and have all the other modules use
    it, this will allow for adding a unit test suite.
  * Add unit tests for several core functions, including globlist_match,
    dirname, basename, bestlink, linkify, pagetitle, titlepage.
  * Smart globlist merging.
  * Patch from Thomas Schwinge to switch from --svn to --rcs=svn, etc,
    to pave the way for adding other RCS support. This also changes the
    setup files, where before they had svn => 1 or svn => 0, now they have
    rcs => "svn" or rcs => "".
  * Add a debian/NEWS file with upgrade notes.
  * Load whatever rcs module is specified, so new ones can be just dropped in
    as plugins and work. (Well, in theory.)
  * Add some basic docs about writing RCS modules.
  * Broke search capability out into a plugin, removed the --hyperestraier
    switch.
  * Added smiley plugin, nicely controlled and documented by the smileys page.
  * Copied in some smileys from Moin Moin.
  * Allow links of the form [[some page|page]], with whitespace in the link
    text.
  * Removed --sanitize and --no-sanitize, replaced with --plugin htmlscrubber
    and --disable-plugin htmlscrubber.
  * Allow discussion links on pages to be turned off with --no-discussion.
  * Add ikiwiki-mass-rebuild script, ripped out of the postinst.
  * Add some new config items to the estseek.conf template, which are needed
    by hyperestraier 1.2.3.
