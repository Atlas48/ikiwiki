ikiwiki (1.45) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Allow for underscores to appear in page titles, if encoded appropriately
    (__95__) in filenames. Previously, all underscores were replaced with
    spaces. Thanks, Enrico Zini for noticing that bug.
  * Add "template" option to inline plugin to allow for use of customised
    templates.
  * Add titlepage template for inline plugin.
  * Add preview parameter to preprocesser calls, use this rather than the
    previous ugly hack used to avoid writing rss feeds in previews.
  * Fix the img plugin to avoid overwriting images in previews. Instead it
    does all the work to make sure the resizing works, and dummys up a resized
    image using width and height attributes.
  * Also fixes img preview display, the links were wrong in preview before.
  * Add a sparkline plugin.

ikiwiki (1.44) unstable; urgency=low

  * Patch by Ben to fix validaton of atom feeds by fixing the category tags.
  * Add a openidlogin-bg.gif to wikiicons and have the stylesheet use it for the
    OpenID login form rather than linking to a remote logo, to avoid various
    issues. Since there is not yet a license for the actual OpenID logo, this
    file is currently a blank image. Users who want to can copy
    http://openid.net/login-bg.gif into their wiki.
  * Allow setting NOTAINT=1 when building the wiki to remove taint checking
    flags, which can be useful on some hosting providers.
  * Fix a bug that made links like [[0|foo]] use "foo" as the link text,
    instead of "0".
  * Changed calling convention for httmllink slightly. The first three
    parameters remain the same, but additional options are now passed in using
    named parameters.
  * Change plugin interface version to 1.02 to reflect this change.
  * Add a new anchor option to htmllink. Thanks Ben for the idea.
  * Support anchors in wikilinks.
  * Add a "more" plugin based on one contributed by Ben to allow implementing
    those dreaded "Read more" links in blogs.
  * Don't error out if estcmd fails, just print a warning message. estcmd is
    too fragile to let it kill ikiwiki.
  * Make img plugin not fail immediately if Image::Magick is not available.
    This lets ikiwiki not build depend on perlmagic.
  * Detect old versions of xgettext and avoid using them.
  * perl is broken: print "" || die fails! Work around this insanity.
  * Smarter detection of no-op changes to po files.
  * Elegant patch from Ethan to clean up the display of page names in the
    dropdown when creating a new page.
  * Since the CGI had to drop the wiki lock to avoid deadlocking the
    commit hook, it was possible for one CGI to race another one and "win"
    the commit of both their files. This race has been fixed by adding a new
    commitlock, which when locked by the CGI, disables the commit hook
    (except for commit mails). The CGI then takes care of the updates the
    commit hook would have done.
  * French translation update. Closes: #411899
  * Patch from HenrikBrixAndersen to fix a broken use of foreach in the
    search plugin.
  * Correct a bug that could lead to infinite looping after signin in some
    circumstances.
  * Patch from Ethan to improve behavior if a page is deleted or moved while
    someone is editing it.
  * Some cleanup of field setting in the failed edit and conflict handling
    code.

ikiwiki (1.43) unstable; urgency=low

  * Allow plugins to add new types of tests that can be used in PageSpecs.
  * Add a "conditional" plugin, which allows displaying text if a condition
    is true. It is enabled by default so conditional can be used in the
    basewiki.
  * Use conditionals in the template for plugins, so that plugin pages
    say if they're currently enabled or not, and in various other places
    in the wiki.
  * Updated Spanish translation.
  * Make the basewiki be full of symlinks to pages that should be the same
    in the doc wiki. This will allow direct edits to alter the base wiki
    without manual munging.
  * Fix the template, toggle, and conditional plugins to filter text before
    preprocessing it.
  * Fix smiley plugin to support smileys at the very beginning or end of
    the content.
  * Allow multiple tag settings to appear in a single page.
  * Many changes to make ikiwiki very resistant to write failures
    including out of disk space situations. ikiwiki should never leave
    truncated files, and if the error occurs during a web-based file edit,
    the user will be given an opportunity to retry.
    Inspired by the many ways Moin Moin destroys itself when out of disk. :-)
  * Fix syslogging of errors.
  * Patch from Ethan to allow using meta tags to set creation dates of pages.
  * Add a prettydate plugin that formats dates in a more readable fashion.
    (I had to get a pretty date somehow today..)
  * Updated Czech translation.
  * Avoid potential syslog format string issue, although only older versions
    of perl are vulnerable and it is not known to really be exploitable from
    ikiwiki.
  * Add explicit module prereqs to Makefile.PL
  * New domain name for ikiwiki: ikiwiki.info. Update your links.

ikiwiki (1.42) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix several more missing translations of Discussion.
  * Fix for missing backlinks() in pagestats plugin.
  * Add canedit hook, allowing arbitrary controls over when a page can be
    edited.
  * Move code forcing signing before edit to a new "signinedit" plugin, and
    code checking for locked pages into a new "lockedit" plugin. Both are
    enabled by default.
  * Remove the anonok config setting. This is now implemented by a new
    "anonok" plugin. Anyone with a wiki allowing anonymous edits should
    change their configs to enable this new plugin.
  * Add an opendiscussion plugin that allows anonymous users to edit
    discussion pages, on a wiki that otherwise wouldn't allow it.
  * Lots of CGI code reorg and cleanup.
  * Avoid using lots of memory when copying large non-html files.
    Yes, you can keep videos in the wiki..
  * Add feedshow option to allow reducing the number of items included in
    an rss or atom feed.
  * Change based on a patch from Ethan to support relative matching in
    PageSpecs, by using "./".
  * pagespec_match() has grown a new third parameter to support this.
  * Add "reverse" option to inline to invert sort orders.
  * Drop the BSD license for the templates and basewiki, and just allow them
    to be used as close to public domain as possible.
  * viewcvs is now viewvc (in Debian unstable), update everything to use the
    new name.
  * Fix a security hole that allowed a web user to edit images and other
    non-page format files in the wiki. To exploit this, the file already had
    to exist in the wiki, and the web user would need to somehow use the web
    based editor to replace it with malicious content.
    (Sorry Josh, this means you can't edit style.css directly anymore,
    although I do appreciate your fixes, actually..)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 10 Feb 2007 15:37:39 -0500

ikiwiki (1.41) unstable; urgency=low

  * Gettext 1.04 or up is needed for the OO interface that ikiwiki needs,
    if an older version is installed, just don't gettext strings, instead of
    crashing.
  * Added smileys for Moin Moin compatability.
  * Fix handling of discussion links on discussion pages when l10n is used.
  * Make gitorigin_branch and gitmaster_branch configurable via the setup
    file. Closes: #408599
  * French translation update. Closes: #408593
  * Improve use of svn merge, by specifying the file to merge, rather than
    chdiring to the srcdir (which wasn't right when merging in a subdir).
    Thanks Ethan.
  * Always call rcs_update after a commit during a web edit, to work around
    the problem described in bugs/svn_fails_to_update. Thanks to Ethan for the
    analysis and patch.
  * Replace underscores in shortcut texts with spaces when formatting for
    display. This allows using a shortcut like [[wikipedia War_of_1812]],
    which links to the correct remote page, but is displayed nicely.
  * When building the doc wiki, build with LANG=C.
  * More gettext fun.
  * Fix openid signin secret generation code. This fixes the bug that made
    all openid signins fail the first time, and then succeed the second
    time.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 30 Jan 2007 02:36:53 -0500

ikiwiki (1.40) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix missing categories in rss/atom feeds.
  * Add French translation by Jean-Luc Coulon. Closes: #406881
  * Fix bogus use of CDATA in atom feeds. Closes: #406898

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 14 Jan 2007 21:42:27 -0500

ikiwiki (1.39) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add a rawhtml plugin that allows copying raw html files from the srcdir.
  * Fix --locale to control LC_ALL now.
  * Include the pot file in the source tarball. Closes: #405890
  * Add a Swedish translation by Daniel Nylander. Closes: #406410
  * Add a Czech translation by Miroslav Kure.
  * Add a Bulgarian translation by Damyan Ivanov. Closes: #406580
  * Add a Gujarati translation by Kartik Mistry. Closes: #406635
  * Add a Vietnamese translation by Clytie Siddall.
  * Fix encoding issue with use of Locale::Gettext. Seems that the OO
    interface returns proper utf-8 decoded strings, unlike the traditional
    interface, so use the OO interface.
  * Search in default location for templates as a fallback when templatedir is
    pointed elsewhere, so that only modified templates need to be copied into
    a templatedir. Based on work by JeremyReed.
  * In the aggregator, check for and deal with post filenames that are
    longer than the maximum file length.
  * Change the RecentChanges page to show the path of changed pages.
  * Various minor bugfixes.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 13 Jan 2007 23:30:20 -0500

ikiwiki (1.38) unstable; urgency=low

  * Corrected a bum regexp in openid munging.
  * Added a Spanish translation by Victor Moral.
  * A few translation infrastructure fixes.
  * Added a Polish translation by Paweł Tęcza.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri,  5 Jan 2007 23:13:59 -0500

ikiwiki (1.37) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add mirrorlist plugin.
  * Fixed permissions of some files that were 600 in the tarball. (Did not
    affect the deb).
  * Avoid creating edit links when the cgi url is not known.
  * Avoid displaying discussion links at all, if there's not a discussion
    page, when the cgi url isn't known.
  * Before, svn was used as the RCS by default unless configured otherwise,
    now it defaults to using no RCS unless configured to do so, to avoid some
    suprising behavior when using a setup file and not uncommenting any RCS
    options.
  * Fix some bugs in the commit email sending code.
  * Improve code that ignores files in the underlaydir if the srcdir has a
    file building the same page. Now it will work even if the extensions of
    the source files differ.
  * Initial work on internationalization of the program code. po/ikiwiki.pot
    is available for translation.
  * Export gettext() from IkiWiki module.
  * Don't put discussion links on discussion pages.
  * Allow disabling of plugins included in goodstuff.
  * Add a textile format plugin contributed by mazirian.
  * If a userdir is configured, links to pages in it can be made without
    specifying the path. This allows for easy signing of comments by linking
    to your page in the userdir.
  * Escape slashes in page titles entered in the blog post form.
  * Munge openids of the form somehost.com/user (trial, may revert).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 31 Dec 2006 17:31:22 -0500

ikiwiki (1.36) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix various links on the hyperestraier pages.
  * Use POST for poll to avoid some robots.
  * Fix sometimes broken links to Discussion pages from blog pages.
  * Add userdir config setting.
  * Fix man page perms in install.
  * Fix an issue with inlining a page with a rss feed inside another
    page with an rss feed.
  * Turn $config{wiki_file_prune_regexps} into an array that is easier to
    manipulate.
  * Only exclude rss and atom files from processing if the inline plugin
    is enabled and that feed type is enabled. Else it's just a copyable file
    type.
  * Move rss and atom option handling code into the inline plugin.
  * Applied a rather old patch from Recai to fix the "pruning is too strict"
    issue. Now you can have wiki source directories inside dotdirs and the
    like, if you want.
  * Patch from Emanuele Aina to fix modification time code in mercurual
    backend.
  * Add support for links of the form [[/foo]]
  * Fix code to make absolute urls for rss feeds, was missing some urls.
  * Fix double-escaping of html entities in titles etc in rss feeds
    that occured if escaped characters were present in the page filename.

  * Fix daemonisation code to only do daemon setup things after forking the
    child process.
  * The hack used to make the pagetemplate hook have access to the editpage
    template won't work with CGI::FormBuilder 3.0401, so disable it for now.
  * CGI::FormBuilder 3.0401 seems to work ok now with ikiwiki, although
    there might still be bugs lurking..

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri,  1 Dec 2006 19:14:36 -0500

ikiwiki (1.34.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Allow /etc/ikiwiki/wikilist to list just the names of users, if so then
    ~user/.ikiwiki/wikilist will be read.
  * Fix url absolution code in inline plugin to support class and id fields in
    links and imgs, and to support anchor urls.
  * More build deps updates.
  * /dev/null fortune failures

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 28 Nov 2006 12:58:47 -0500

ikiwiki (1.34.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add libtime-duration-perl to build deps, as it's used by the svn module
    which is now tested at build.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 27 Nov 2006 12:26:12 -0500

ikiwiki (1.34) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add an openid plugin to support logging in using OpenID.
  * Web commits by OpenID users will record the full OpenID url for the user,
    but in recentchanges, these urls will be converted to a simplified display
    form+link.
  * Modified svn, git, tla backends to recognise such web commits.
  * Move httpauth support to a plugin.
  * Add openidsignup config option.
  * Make the openid plugin support the callbacks from myopenid.com via its
    affiliate program.
  * Add toggle plugin.
  * Add a poll plugin.
  * Add quick mode for archive page generation.
  * Introduce the goodstuff bundle. This is a kind of plugin, that just enables
    many other plugins. It's an easy way to boost ikiwiki from its default,
    basic wiki, to a full-featured wiki, without manually picking the right
    set of plugins. New plugins will be added to goodstuff from time to
    time.
  * Change how post signin actions are propigated through the signin process;
    they're now stored in the session.
  * Add optional "desc" parameter to shortcut definitions.
  * Avoid locking the wiki at all when handling some basic cgi stuff
    (searches, recentchanges).
  * Add "last" parameter to hook function. Very basic ordering, and hopefully
    nothing more spohisticated will be needed.
  * Add formbuilder_setup and formbuilder hooks.
  * Split out a passwordauth module, that holds all the traditional password
    based authentication etc code. It's enabled by default, but can be disabled
    if you want only openid or some other auth method.
  * Rename ikiwiki.pl so MakeMaker doesn't see it, and install it.
  * Add some code to the build system that tries to determine if the
    lib installation directory is in @INC. If it's not, munge ikiwiki
    to hardcode the path to the lib directory. This should allow installing
    ikiwiki in nonstandard locations, including home directories, by just
    setting PREFIX at build time.
  * Fix nested examples directory in deb.
  * Add a test suite for the mercurial backend, contributed by Emanuele Aina.
  * Add a test suite for the svn backend.
  * Add a test suite for the git backend, from Recai
  * Daemonize before sending RPC pings, since that can take a while
    and/or hang.
  * Daemonize before sending commit mails, as that can also take a long
    time/hang if the mail server is unhappy.
  * Factor out commit mail sending code into new function.
  * Change rcs_commit, it is now passed the name of the user doing the commit
    and their IP address, and needs to construct its own commit message
    containing them, or do something more appropriate for the given RCS.
  * Add softwaresite example.
  * Mercurial backend improvements, including --get-ctime support. (Emanuele
    Aina)
  * Git backend improvements, including bug fixes and better robustness,
    from Recai.

  * Fix issue with aggregate plugin updating expired pages.
  * Avoid syntax errors in templates used by the template plugin crashing
    ikiwiki.
  * Enable utf8 file IO in aggregate plugin.
  * Fix some issues with the new registration form.
  * Patch from Ethan Glasser Camp to add a skip option to the inline plugin.
  * Make sure to check for errors from every eval.
  * Fix img plugin's handling of adding dependencies for images that do not
    yet exist.
  * Work around a strange bug in CGI::FormBuilder 3.0401 that makes
    FORM-SUBMIT unusable on customised formbuilder templates. For now,
    hardcode the submit buttons in editpage.tmpl instead of using the
    template variable, which is ok, since the buttons are static.
  * Work with hyperestraier 1.4.9.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 15 Nov 2006 18:32:26 -0500

ikiwiki (1.32) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add a separate pass to find page links, and only render each page once,
    instead of over and over. Typical speedup is ~4x. Max possible speedup:
    8x.
  * Add "scan" parameter to hook(), which is used to make the hook be called
    during the scanning pass, as well as the render pass. The meta and tag
    plugins need to use the new scan parameter, so will any others that modify
    %links.
  * Now that links are calculated in a separate pass, it can also
    precalculate backlinks in one pass, which is O(N^2) instead of the
    previous code that was O(N^3). A very nice speedup for wikis with lots
    (thousands) of pages.
  * Stylish update to the ikiwiki logo, thanks to Recai Oktaş and Selçuk
    Erdem.
  * Add a default stylesheet entry for the pagecloud.
  * Add examples page with some examples of things that can be done using
    ikiwiki, like a weblog. The examples can be copied into a user's wiki
    for a quick start, without needing to learn everything about how to put
    them together.
  * Install the source of the examples into /usr/share/doc/ikiwiki/examples.
  * Add perlmagick to build-depends so syntax check of img plugin works.
    Closes: #396702
  * Improve login/register process, the login dialog has only name and
    password fields, which allows more web browsers to regognise it as a login
    field, and is less confusing.
  * Implemented expiry options for aggregate plugin.
  * Use precalculated backlinks info when determining if files need an update
    due to a page they link to being added/removed. Mostly significant if
    there are lots of pages.
  * Remove duplicate link info when saving index. In some cases it could
    pile up rather badly. (Probably not the best way to deal with this
    problem.)
  * Patch from James Westby to support podcasting, photoblogging, vidcasting,
    or what have you, by creating enclosures for non-page items that are
    included in feeds.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri,  3 Nov 2006 14:46:37 -0500

ikiwiki (1.31) unstable; urgency=low

  * Patch from Pawel Tecza to cp -a the templates in the Makefile.
  * Change the rss feed title from the wikiname to the page title, with
    an exception for the wiki's toplevel index page, which will still use the
    wikiname as the feed title.
    Overriding the page title with meta title already overrode the rss feed
    tittle.
  * Add an img plugin, based on Christian Mock's img plugin, but stripped
    down to the bare essentials. Useful for handling large images on websites.
  * Sanitize possibly problimatic characters out of the polygen grammar names,
    just in case. Should not be exploitable anyway, since it only tries to run
    polygen after finding the specified grammar file.
  * Add missing dependency on the URI perl module.
  * Add basic spam fighting tool for admins: An admin's prefs page now allows
    editing a list of banned users.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 27 Oct 2006 23:16:33 -0400

ikiwiki (1.30) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add no_override parameter to hook().
  * Add a shortcut plugin, inspired by Victor Moral's contributed shortcuts
    plugin, but featuring a more ikiwiki-ish syntax and with shortcuts that
    can be configured using a page in wiki.
  * Fix support for --pingurl at the command line.
  * Fix a subtle bug in will_render that broke some builds, by only clearing
    items from renderedfiles the first time per build.
  * Wrap entire technortati ping operation in an eval to catch all possible
    failure modes, after I observed a simple ->value crashing ikiwiki when
    a ping failed.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 16 Oct 2006 15:17:38 -0400

ikiwiki (1.29) unstable; urgency=low

  * Patch from Paul Tötterman to use CP in the Makefile.
  * Patch from Alec Berryman adding a http_auth config item that allows
    using HTTP Authentication instead of ikiwiki's built in authentication.
    Useful for eg, large sites with their own previously existing user auth
    setup. Closes: #384534
  * Change %renderedfiles to store an array of files rendered from a given
    source file, to allow tracking of extra rendered files like rss feeds.
  * Note that plugins that accessed this variable will need to be updated!
    The plugin interface has been increased to version 1.01 for this change.
    As few plugins use %renderedfiles I haven't done anything else to ensure
    compatability of old plugins.
  * Add will_render function to the plugin interface, used to register that a
    page renders a destination file, and do some security checks. Previously
    but no longer rendered files will be cleaned up.
  * Use will_render in the inline and linkmap plugins.
  * You will need to rebuild your wiki on upgrade to this version.
  * Atom feed support based on a patch by Clint Adams.
  * Add feeds=no option to inline preprocessor directive to turn off all types
    of feeds.
  * $IkiWiki::version now holds the program version, and is accessible to
    plugins.
  * Make the aggregate plugin emphasize error messages.
  * Patch from Recai to limit recentchanges to displaying max 10 files for a
    given changeset (to avoid large number of file changes excessively
    bloating the page).

  * Fix a forkbomb in various calls to IPC::Open2, which has a highly
    braindead interface. Closes: #389383
  * Don't rm -rf ikiwiki on distclean, since a) there's no such file
    and b) those poor Mac OSX users and their case insensative files!
  * Don't fail syntax check if Text::Typography isn't installed.
    Closes: #389406

ikiwiki (1.27) unstable; urgency=low

  * Work on firming up the plugin interface:
    - Plugins should not need to load IkiWiki::Render to get commonly
      used functions, so moved some functions from there to IkiWiki.
    - Picked out the set of functions and variables that most plugins
      use, documented them, and made IkiWiki export them by default,
      like a proper perl module should.
    - Use the other functions at your own risk.
    - This is not quite complete, I still have to decide whether to
      export some other things.
  * Changed all plugins included in ikiwiki to not use "IkiWiki::" when
    referring to stuff now exported by the IkiWiki module.
  * Add a module version number to IkiWiki, so you can "use IkiWiki '1.00'"
    to declare which version of the interface your plugin needs.
  * Anyone with a third-party ikiwiki plugin is strongly encouraged
    to make like changes to it and avoid use of non-exported symbols from
    "IkiWiki::".
  * Link debian/changelog and debian/news to NEWS and CHANGELOG.
  * Support hyperestradier version 1.4.2, which adds a new required phraseform
    setting.
  * If an inlined page has a permalink, link the page title to that.
  * Patch from Recai to use utf8 when reading the setup file, so that
    utf8 wikinames from there will be used properly.
  * Patch from Recai to kill utf-8 on the wiki name when generating the
    session cookie.
  * Change ddate plugin to use the DateTime::Calendar::Discordian perl module.
  * Fix a baseurl problem in hyperestradier search results.
  * Add a stub local.css to avoid problems with 404's.
  * Patch from Recai to fix a wide character warning from the search plugin
    during setup if the wikiname contains utf8.
  * Yet another fix for those poor case-insensative OS X users.
  * pagetemplate hooks are now also called when generating cgi pages.
  * Add a favicon plugin, which simply adds a link tag for an icon to each
    page (and cgis).
  * Patch from James Westby to deal with the case where you're editing a
    new page, hit cancel, and need to be redirected to somewhere sane.
  * Various documentation improvements by various wiki users.
  * Support Text::Markdown from CPAN, which has a different interface from
    the original markdown or the one in Debian.
  * Version the libcgi-session-perl dependency, some features that need
    the new version are used in some cases (sslcookie).
  * Numerous tla fixes from Clint.
  * Updated ikiwiki.svgz from Recai, includes an icon and is used to generate
    a multi-resolution favicon.ico.
  * README.Debian: typo Closes: #388110
  * chomp trailing newline at the end of templates read in by the template
    plugin, to allow use of the template preprocessor directive in
    whitespace-sensative situations. Closes: #387073
  * Patch from James Westby to make the location of the estseek.cgi script
    configurable.
  * Add typography (SmartyPants) plugin by Recai.
  * Add --render mode, which can be used to preview an edit at the command
    line by test rendering a single page.
  * Add a googlecalendar plugin. A bit special-purpose, but it shows
    one way to to deal with user-supplied content that could cause XSS
    issues w/o the htmlscrubber, and won't survive the scrubber.

  * Add a missing -n to tla undo call.
  * otl2hmtl can't be safely used with IPC::Open2 since it sometimes
    writes before consuming its whole stdin. Avoid this deadlock.
  * Fix alt tags for outline checkboxes.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri,  8 Sep 2006 16:24:16 -0400

ikiwiki (1.25) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add proper waitpid calls for open2ed processes throughout to avoid
    zombies; this hit htmltidy especially badly.
  * Drop real uid/gid in the suid wrapper, thus allowing commits to remote
    subversion repos and fixing some other issues.
  * Add support for tla, contributed by Clint Adams. Closes: #385936
  * Add support for mercurial, contributed by Emanuele Aina.
  * Include <link rel> tag for RSS feeds, used by some aggregators and
    firefox to find the feed.
  * Add a linkmap plugin (requires graphviz).

  * Simplify the data structure returned by rcs_recentchanges to avoid
    each rcs plugin needing to form complex strings on its own.
  * Fix another destpage issue in the inline directive. Closes: #385512
    again.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun,  3 Sep 2006 15:46:45 -0400

ikiwiki (1.22) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change how the stylesheet url is determined in the templates: Remove
    STYLEURL and add BASEURL to all templates (some already had it). This
    new more general variable can be used to link to other things (eg, images)
    from the template, as well as stylesheets.
  * Fix a bug introduced last version to do with nested inlines.
  * Allow preprocessor directives to span multiple lines, both to make
    long ones with lots of values easier to write, and to allow for ones with
    multi-line quoted values.
  * Allow preprocessor directives to contain python-like triple-quoted
    text blocks, for easy nesting of quotes inside.
  * Add a template plugin.
  * Make pagespec merge code smarter about merging duplicate pagespecs.
  * Patch from Jordà Polo to make Setup::Standard support hashes in config
    files.
  * Change order of linkify and preprocess; first preprocess and then linkify.
    This allows passing a wikilink inside a parameter to a preprocessor
    directive without it being expanded to html, and leaking out of the
    parameter, which had required some non-obvious use of triple-quoting
    to avoid. Note that any preprocessor plugins that output something
    that looks like a wikilink will now have it treated as such; AFAIK
    this doesn't change any behavior though except for the template plugin.
  * Enable preprocessor directives when previewing an edit.
  * Make all pages pull in a local.css style sheet, if present. This won't
    be included in ikiwiki, but can be created to make local styling changes
    w/o needing to merge in every new change to the distributed style.css.
  * Use DESTDIR and not PREFIX to specify installation prefix for packaging.
  * Support running "perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=foo" to build ikiwiki to run
    from a different directory.
  * Generalised preprocesser loop protection code.
  * Patch from James Westby to allow a description to be set for rss feeds.
  * Patch from James Westby to add a template for the search form.
  * Added a ddate plugin.
  * Patch from James Westby to add a --sslcookie switch, which forces
    cookies to only be sent over ssl connections to avoid interception.
  * Fix preferences page on anonok wikis; still need to sign in to get
    to the preferences page.
  * Add toc (table of contents) plugin.
  * Change htmlize, format, and sanitize hooks to use named parameters.
  * Patch from James Westby to add an actions option to inline; this
    adds Edit and Discussion links at the end of blog entries.
  * Due to some css changes, you'll want to rebuild your wiki on upgrade
    to this version. Will be handled automatically by the deb.
  * Add processed date to aggregate preprocessor directive status output.

ikiwiki (1.21) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add a tail fin^W^Wsidebar plugin by Tuomo Valkonen.
  * If a page links to itself, mark up the link text in a span with
    class="selflink" so that it can be styled. I don't have a useful style
    defined for that though.
  * Call filter hooks on inlined page content.
  * Support inlining pages raw, rather than creating a blog.
  * Clean up yes/no parameter parsing in inline plugin.
  * Implemented better cycle detection in the inline plugin; nested inlines
    will now work.
  * Add a map plugin contributed by Alessandro Dotti Contra.
  * Add otl format plugin, which handles files as created by vimoutliner.
  * Fix ikiwiki-mass-rebuild to work in the way the postinst uses it.
  * Add first draft at a Restructured Text (rst) plugin, by Sergio
    Talens-Oliag. Note that this has many known issues -- see the caveats on
    the plugin's page.
  * Credit everyone who wrote a plugin on the plugins' wiki pages.
  * Fix utf-8 in blog post form.

  * Relicense the templates and basewiki under the 2-clause BSD license.
    Since these can easily become part of other people's websites, they
    should be under as permissive a license as possible.
  * Add --syslog config option, to log to the syslog.
  * Catch failing IPC::Open2 in tidy plugin and retry in case this is a
    transient failure to fork (which I've seen happen in the wild).
  * Fix a bug in the aggregator introduced last version that caused all
    aggregator state to be lost during a non-aggregating build.

  * Add some locking to prevent 2 aggregators from running at once.
  * Fix an infinite loop in the aggregator when finding a unique filename.

ikiwiki (1.18) unstable; urgency=low

  * The last release accidentially installed ikiwiki as ikiwiki.pl, now fixed.
  * Add --version.
  * Man page format fixups.
  * If the meta plugin overides the page title, set a title_overridden
    variable in the template to true. This allows doing things with the
    templates conditional on the title being overriden.
  * Add a %pagecase which maps lower-case page names to the actual case
    used in the filename. Use this in bestlinks calculation instead of
    forcing the link to lowercase.
  * Also use %pagecase in various other places that want to check if a page
    with a given name exists.
  * This means that links to pages with mixed case names will now work,
    even if the link is in some other case mixture, and mixed case pages
    should be fully supported throughout ikiwiki.
  * Recommend rebuilding wikis on upgrade to this version.

ikiwiki (1.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Disable tidy generator tag.
  * Move tidy back to sanitize hook, found out how to only show body.
  * Turn off tidy indentation too.
  * Turn on HTML::Template loop_context_vars; not actually used in stock
    templates but can be useful for things like making comma-delimited lists
    of tags or what have you.
  * Remove <br> from end of aggregate preprocessor directive output.
  * Ship ikiwiki executable as ikiwiki.pl in source to avoid issues on
    case-sensative filesystems like OSX.
  * Improve markdown loading. First, try to load it as a proper perl module,
    in case it was installed as one. Then fall back to trying
    /usr/bin/markdown.
  * Document in install page how to install markdown, since it has no
    installation procedure in the upstream tarball.
  * Set die_on_bad_params => 0 for all templates, to allow users to modify
    them without annoyances.
  * Suck in the page content when generating an inline archive page, to work
    around the meta plugin's lack of caching of title metadata across runs.

ikiwiki (1.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * Try to handle relative links in aggregated feeds. However,
    the current support is a crude hack due to limitations of XML::Feed:
    xml:base is not supported, neither is Content-Location. And of course,
    relative links in RSS feeds are ill-undefined..
  * Make aggregator save permalinks and author name to pages as metadata.
  * Add permalink and author support to meta plugin, affecting RSS feeds
    and blog pages.
  * Various CSS and formatting changes.
  * Encode link and guid urls in rss feeds to avoid illegal utf8 slipping in.
  * Add xhtml files to the default prune regexp.
  * Also generate rel=bookmark links for permalinks.
  * Fix the htmltidy plugin, which wasn't working due my breaking it when
    I added it..
  * Don't run tidy with -xml as that fails if the input is not well-formed.
    Run it with -asxhtml instead, so it will output well-formed xhtml no
    matter what the input.
  * Disable tidy warnings too.
  * Add a new format hook, and make tidy use it, since tidy can really only
    operate on and output complete html documents, not the body chunks
    that sanitise gets.
  * Fix dates in rss feeds if running localised, so they're still rfc 822.

ikiwiki (1.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * ikiwiki can now download and aggregate feeds with its new aggregate
    plugin, so it's possible to implement a Planet using ikiwiki!
  * Add a run_hooks function for the common task of running all hooks of a
    given type.
  * Add a savestate hook.
  * Don't put blog post forms on pages if there's no cgiurl set.
  * --setup --refresh no longer rebuilds wrappers. Use --setup --refresh
    --wrappers to do that.
  * Add %IkiWiki::forcerebuild to provide a way for plugins like aggregate
    to update pages that haven't changed on disk.
  * Change meta tags to use html entity-escaped text for values, so that
    quotes and such can be represented in title tags.
  * Depend and build-depend on HTML::Parser for HTML::Entities which is used
    for the above.
  * Make --rebuild also cause --aggregate to re-download and write aggregated
    pages.
  * Avoid outputting duplicate meta info.
  * Include title metadata on aggregated posts for capitalised and un-munged
    titles.
  * Title metadata of inlined pages now shows up in blogs and rss feeds.
  * Fix issue with unicode filenames and updating the hyper estradier search
    index. (Aka Please Please Please, let that be the last one.)
  * Patch from Roland Mas to support an rss=no parameter to inline directives.
    Closes: #380743
  * Renamed GlobLists to PageSpecs.
  * PageSpecs can now include nested parens, "and", and "or". This remains
    backwards compatible to the old GlobList format. It's implemented by
    treating the GlobList as a very limited microlanguage that is transformed
    to perl code that does the matching.
  * The old GlobList format is deprecated, and I encourage users to switch to
    using the new PageSpec format. Compatability with the old format will be
    removed at some point, possibly by 2.0.
  * Wiki rebuild needed on upgrade to this version due to PageSpec change.
  * Add support for creation_month and creation_year to PageSpec.
    Closes: #380680
  * Changes to index file encoding.

  "Viva l'Italia!"
  * New pagestats plugin from Enrico, which can generate a table counting
    the backlinks for each page, or a del.icio.us style cloud.
  * Build-depend on libtext-wikiformat-perl, so that the syntax check of
    the wikiformat plugin works. Thanks, Emanuele Aina.
  * Patch from Alessandro Dotti Contra to clean up backlinks and navbar
    display, running them through pagetitle. This removes ugly underscores and
    other gunk from the display, much nicer. You may want to rebuild your wiki
    when upgrading to get the cleanup globally.
  * Polygen plugin from Enrico.
  * htmltidy plugin from Faidon.
  * Locale patch from Faidon:
    - Adds a locale setting to setup files.
    - Proper local time, if the locale configuration option is used.
    - Support for UTF-8 (or ISO-8859-X) filenames in SVN. Before this patch,
      commiting (or even rcs_updating) on repositories with UTF-8 filenames was
      impossible.
  * Add getopt hook type, this allows plugins to add new command-line options.
  * Add --tagbase option to tag plugin.
  * Add exclude option in setup files, works same as --exclude.
  * Put categories in rss feeds for tagged items.
  * Allow preprocessor directives to be expanded in inlined blog pages.
    However, to avoid inlining loops etc, don't expand inline directives in
    inlined pages.
  * fortune plugin (trivial)
  * Tag plugins according to type.

ikiwiki (1.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Patch from Enrico that
    - Adds a tag plugin that allows more easily tagging pages.
      The meta plugin can also still be used for that, but the tag plugin
      also lists a page's tags at the bottom of the page.
    - Allows preprocessor directives to have parameters with no specified
      value.
    - Fixes preprocessor directive parameter parsing so that
      foo=bar baz now means "foo=bar" and a "baz" with no value.
  * Run pagetemplate hooks when inlining pages so that inlined pages also
    list their tags.
  * Make all plugins with pagetemplate hooks check that variables exist
    on the template before setting them, for robustness.
  * Switch pagetemplate hooks to using named parameters.
  * Pass a destpage parameter to preprocessor and pagetemplate hooks.
    This will be the page that a source page will be part of, which is
    different than the source page for inlined pages.
  * Audited all plugins to endure they pass (page, destpage) to htmllink
    appropriatly. This means inlining of various plugins will not work
    properly, with correct links generated.

  * Run page through any relevant filters when generating a page preview.
  * Noticed a bug in the wikitext markup plugin -- it made CamelCase links the
    default throughout the wiki, not only on wikitext pages. Decided to call
    this a feature, and split the camelcase support out into a separate plugin
    that is independant of wikitext.
  * Fix CamelCase regexp to not break [[FooBar|BazBar]] WikiLinks.

ikiwiki (1.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Improve display of parentlinks and page title of toplevel index page.
  * Patch from Faidon to use svn --limit when possible for recentchanges,
    speeds up recentchanges a lot for wikis with more history.
  * Patch from Recai to fix utf8 issues in git backend.
  * Add wikitext markup plugin, which supports ".wiki" pages written in the
    original wiki syntax, CamelCase links and all.
  * Support a w3mmode, which lets w3m run ikiwiki using its local CGI
    support, to edit pages etc without a web server.
  * Display CGI processing errors if present.
  * Fix from Faidon for a XML parser issue that breaks utf-8 for
    RecentChanges. Avoid using XML::SAX::PurePerl, which is buggy in this
    area, and also way slow.
  * Match 'web commit from' in SVN and git, these are web commits too.
    (Faidon)
  * Consolidated all decode_utf8 in FormBuilder's fields to make the code more
    readable and avoid future mistakes. The patch seems to work and for the
    first time I have a UTF-8 username ;-) (Faidon)
  * Use form->field consistently, not form->param.
  * Patch from Recai to allow selection of page type when creating a new page.
    Default page type is inherited from the link clicked on to create the new
    page.

ikiwiki (1.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix orphans plugin to not count a link to a nonexistant page as a reason
    for a page not being an orphan.
  * Support pinging services such as Technorati using XML-RPC to notify them
    about changes to rss feeds.
  * Parse svn log as xml for improved utf8 and security. Note that this makes
    ikiwiki depend on XML::Simple. Patch by Faidon Liambotis.
  * POSIX::strftime doesn't know about encodings and doesn't return a utf8
    flagged string even if the locale causes it to generate utf8 output,
    so make sure to let perl know it should be handled as utf8. Also,
    the optimised version used for standard time formats won't work if the
    user has changed locale, so drop it. Thanks, Faidon Liambotis.
  * Fix re-encoding of the comments field to utf8 if a commit fails
    due to a conflict. Thanks, Faidon Liambotis.
  * Let svn know that commits have utf8 commit messages. Thanks, Faidon
    Liambotis.
  * Add insane double encode/decode to utf8 around call to markdown.
    This works around a truely strange bug, which is apparently a bug in
    perl, #376329. Also added a test case for it.
  * Improve layout of edit page so formatting help link is always visible w/o
    getting in the way of the preview.
  * Centralised all calls to HTML::Template and force all the templates
    to be read as utf8.
  * Support pages with utf8 filenames. Patch by Faidon Liambotis.
  * Introduce add_plugins and disable_plugins config options in setup files.
    This allows adding or removing plugins w/o overriding the whole list of
    default plugins, which makes it easier to upgrade when new default plugins
    are added.
  * Support htmlize plugins and make mdwn one such plugin, which is enabled by
    default (of course!). Based on a patch by Faidon Liambotis.
  * Add a html plugin, which can be used to write wikis in raw html,
    if you'd ever want to do such a thing. Slightly tricky, since ikiwiki
    defaults to not processing .html files, since w/o this plugin they would
    be copied unsanitised. With this plugin, it will process and html
    sanitise them, like any other page type.
  * Rebuilding wrappers is necessary on upgrade to this version.
  * Make ikiwiki --setup --refresh rebuild wrappers, so wrapper rebuild
    will be automatically done on all upgrades.
  * Don't send pings if the wiki is being rebuilt.
  * Work around very innefficient behavior in File::Spec::abs2rel. Result
    is a savings of 2 pointless fork/execs per link calculation, which
    results in ~25% speedup of ikiwiki building its own doc wiki, and
    about 35% speedup displaying RecentChanges!
  * Make RecentChanges use a table and some CSS, should be much more readable.
    No code changes involved.
  * Encode & in diffurl in examples, to conform to pedantic rules.
  * Speed up RecentChanges by another 40% or so with some memoization.
  * Memoize abs2rel, which is still kinda slow, for another 30% speedup
    in time to build the doc wiki.

ikiwiki (1.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * YA utf-8 patch from Recai, this time to fix previewing a page so that
    the text in the input box is re-encoded back to utf-8.
  * -CSD does not affect modules, so readfile() was not using the utf-8 input
    layer, which led to lots of problems; make it force read files as utf-8.
    Closes: #373203
  * Note that as a consequence, this version of ikiwiki will actually try to
    parse utf8 in source files for the first time, which may expose broken
    utf8 in wiki sources that was hidden before. Most common will be
    perl warnings like "utf8 "\xE9" does not map to Unicode"
  * writefile() likewise needs to use the utf8 output layer.
  * Remove the -CSD from ikiwiki's hashbang since it's useless to have it
    there.
  * Revert some of the decode_utf8 changes in CGI.pm that seem unnecessary
    given the readfile fix.
  * Add utf-8 testcases for readfile and htmlize.
  * Put back the encode_utf8 in the input to markdown; it's really not utf-8
    safe.
  * More utf-8 fixes from Recai, partly to things I broke above:
    - The serious problem is that writefile() saves the content in undecoded
      format in CGI, hence all (non-ascii) chars are corrupted permanently.
    - Comment field in edit page is not decoded and all the non-ascii chars in
      this field are corrupted as the result.  We should decode it as we do it
      for the content.
    - Add 'use encoding "utf8"' to CGI.pm to avoid warnings about wide
      character in print.
  * New SVG logo from Recai.

  * Add --timeformat config option to allow changing how dates are displayed.
    Note that as a side effect, dates will now be displayed using the local
    timezone, not as GMT.
  * More security review.
  * Patch from Dr. Zini to add link() and backlink() to globlists. This allows
    for some handy stuff like:
    - Using links as a kind of tag; creating blog pages that list all pages
      containing a given tag/link or not containing some other tag.
    - Subscribing to mail notifications whenever a change is made to a page
      that is a backlink of page foo. Ie, "Please notify me of changes in all
      pages that link to my home page in the wiki"
    - Locking any pages that are linked to from a particular page, so that
      lists of locks can be exposed in the wiki.
  * Reorganised the doc wiki's todo/* pages, using a link/tag to flag
    when a todo item is done, instead of the previous moving it to a different
    subdir.
  * Allow pagetemplate plugins to override *anything* in the template.
  * Add a meta plugin, which allows specifying various metadata about pages,
    like license and author. It also allows for inserting html link and meta
    tags into html, overriding the title, and adding hidden WikiLinks, which
    can be useful when using link-based globbing for page categorisation.
  * Remove preprocessor directives from inlined pages.
  * Allow simple preprocessor directive values to be specified w/o quotes.
  * Add support for using git instead of subversion as the RCS backend,
    tremendous thanks to Recai Oktaş for this.
  * Doc updates for git.
  * Fix absolute url munging in rss generation to support https, ftp, etc urls
    not just http urls.
  * Patch from Recai Oktaş to improve utf-8 support, it should now use proper
    utf-8 for edit and other fields, and for recentchanges. There may still
    be utf-8 issues with the preferences page though.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 11 Jun 2006 19:56:54 -0400

ikiwiki (1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Tell HTML::Scrubber to treat "/" as a valid attribute which is its
    very strange way of enabling proper XHTML <br /> type tags. Output html
    should be always valid again now.
  * The page name and parent links has switched from using a <h1> to a styled
    <span>, so pages can use <h1> internally instead of needing to use <h2>.
  * Updated all of ikiwiki's own wiki pages for that.
  * Add pagetemplate hook, which can be used by plugins that want to mess
    around with adding new stuff to the page template.
  * Remove headercontent; the search plugin now adds the search box to the
    header by registering a pagetemplate hook, and other plugins should do
    similarly.
  * Rebuilding on upgrade to this version is recommended.
  * Add a html validity check to the test suite, using the wdg-html-validator,
    if available.
  * Make the html valid when there is nothing in the actions list.
  * Reordered some function call parameters for consistency.
  * Enable full utf-8 support for page input and output.
  * Add a workaround for markdown, which does not work well with utf-8
    strings.
  * --getctime had bitrotted (well I only ever used it the once so far..),
    fix and make it a bit more flexible
  * rcs_getctime is changed, now rather than needing to loop over all pages,
    it should just use the rcs to get the ctime of the passed file.
  * When inlining a page in another one, links from the inlined page are now
    expanded the same as they are when rendering the inlined page as a
    standalone page. So rather than being expanded from the POV of the
    inlining page, they are expanded from the POV of the inlined page.

    For example, a link from blog/foo to "bar" will now link to blog/bar
    if it exists. Previously this needed to be a link explicitly to
    "blog/bar"; such links will also continue to work.

    (This was slightly complex to do as the link still has to be constructed
    relative to the inlining page.)
  * Make page edit textarea resize to fit browser window.
  * Add -refresh option to ikiwiki-mass-rebuild and use that on upgrades that
    do not need a full rebuild, in order to update any basewiki pages.

ikiwiki (1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rename inlinepage to depends, so that it can be used to refer to more
    dependency relationships than just inlining. This will require a rebuild
    on upgrade to this version.
  * Move the rss link, put it in the blogpost form if there is one and at the
    top if not. This is both nicer because easier to find, and it cleans up
    the code which had used inlinepage as a flag for adding the link later.
  * Allow the depends GlobList to be built up from multiple sources (such as
    plugins) during a page render.
  * Which means that more than one blog is now supported to appear on a
    single page. (With some limitations, like only the last one getting an
    rss file.)
  * Added a plugin system.
  * Added a pagecount plugin, enabled by default.
  * Support PreProcessorDirectives with no parameters, ie "[[pagecount ]]".
  * Fixed/optimised backlinks code, to avoid rebuilding pages to update
    backlinks when the backlinks hadn't really changed.
  * Moved inline page support, rss generation etc into the inline plugin,
    enabled by default.
  * Added brokenlinks plugin, not enabled by default, but rather handy.
  * Fix several broken links in the doc wiki.
  * Smarter behavior when creating a page and a page of the same name (but
    different location) already exists.
  * Add an orphans plugin for finding pages that nothing links to.
  * Removed backlinks page, which it turns out nothing used.
  * Split off an IkiWiki.pm out of ikiwiki and have all the other modules use
    it, this will allow for adding a unit test suite.
  * Add unit tests for several core functions, including globlist_match,
    dirname, basename, bestlink, linkify, pagetitle, titlepage.
  * Smart globlist merging.
  * Patch from Thomas Schwinge to switch from --svn to --rcs=svn, etc,
    to pave the way for adding other RCS support. This also changes the
    setup files, where before they had svn => 1 or svn => 0, now they have
    rcs => "svn" or rcs => "".
  * Add a debian/NEWS file with upgrade notes.
  * Load whatever rcs module is specified, so new ones can be just dropped in
    as plugins and work. (Well, in theory.)
  * Add some basic docs about writing RCS modules.
  * Broke search capability out into a plugin, removed the --hyperestraier
    switch.
  * Added smiley plugin, nicely controlled and documented by the smileys page.
  * Copied in some smileys from Moin Moin.
  * Allow links of the form [[some page|page]], with whitespace in the link
    text.
  * Removed --sanitize and --no-sanitize, replaced with --plugin htmlscrubber
    and --disable-plugin htmlscrubber.
  * Allow discussion links on pages to be turned off with --no-discussion.
  * Add ikiwiki-mass-rebuild script, ripped out of the postinst.
  * Add some new config items to the estseek.conf template, which are needed
    by hyperestraier 1.2.3.
