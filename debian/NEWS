ikiwiki (1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  There have been several configuration changes in this release of ikiwiki:

  The --svn and --no-svn switches are removed, instead you should use
   --rcs=svn or --no-rcs. ikiwiki setup files that set svn => 1 should
  be changed to set rcs => "svn"; if your setup file sets svn => 0
  then change it to use rcs => "" to disable svn.

  The --hyperestraier switch is gone too. To enable searching, turn on the
  search plugin, by passing --plugin=search or through the plugin setting in
  the setup file.

  The --sanitize and --no-sanitize switches are also gone, replaced with the
  htmlscrubber plugin. This plugin is enabled by default, to disable it,
  use --disable-plugin=htmlscrubber, or modify the plugin setting in the
  setup file.

  If your wiki is configured with a setup file, you will need to add a line
  to enable Discussion links at the top of pages:
  discussion => 1,
  Discussion pages are enabled by default, but old setup files won't enable
  them unless you add tat line.

  You will need to rebuild your wiki when upgrading to this version.
  If you listed your wiki in /etc/ikiwiki/wikilist this will be done
  automatically when the Debian package is upgraded.
