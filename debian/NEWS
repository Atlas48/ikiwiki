ikiwiki (1.13) unstable; urgency=low

  The GlobList format which was used for specifiying sets of pages, has been
  replaced with a new PageSpec format. While GlobLists will continue to work,
  that format is deprecated, and you are recommended to use PageSpecs from now
  on, and also to change any GlobLists in your wiki to PageSpecs. 
  
  See the new PageSpec page for details.
  
  You will need to rebuild your wiki when upgrading to this version. If you
  listed your wiki in /etc/ikiwiki/wikilist this will be done automatically
  when the Debian package is upgraded. Or use ikiiki-mass-rebuild to force a
  rebuild.

ikiwiki (1.11) unstable; urgency=low

  Some changes to tags in this release, due to a new tag plugin. If you have
  been using the meta plugin to tag pages, you'll want to enable the tag
  plugin too, and change things like this:

  [[meta link="foobar"]]

  To this:

  [[tag foobar]]

  The new tags will appear at page footers, and are also easier to type.

  There have also been some changes to the plugin interface, particularly the
  interface of pagetemplate hooks has changed. See the changelog for details.

ikiwiki (1.8) unstable; urgency=low

  If your wiki is configured with a setup file, you should modify it to
  stop setting the "plugin" list directly, and instead add or remove plugins
  via the add_plugins and disable_plugins lines. For example, if you had:

  	plugin => [qw{inline smiley search}],

  Change it to these lines, which disables the default htmlscrubber plugin
  and adds the two additional plugins:

  	add_plugins => [qw{smiley search}],
  	disable_plugins => [qw{htmlscrubber}],

  Making this change makes your ikiwiki setup file more future-proof since
  new default plugins will be automatically used.
  
  You will need to rebuild your ikiwiki wrappers when upgrading to this
  version. If you listed your wiki in /etc/ikiwiki/wikilist this will be
  done automatically when the Debian package is upgraded. Or use
  ikiiki-mass-rebuild --refresh to force a refresh.

ikiwiki (1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  There have been several configuration changes in this release of ikiwiki:

  The --svn and --no-svn switches are removed, instead you should use
   --rcs=svn or --no-rcs. ikiwiki setup files that set svn => 1 should
  be changed to set rcs => "svn"; if your setup file sets svn => 0
  then change it to use rcs => "" to disable svn.

  The --hyperestraier switch is gone too. To enable searching, turn on the
  search plugin, by passing --plugin=search or through the plugin setting in
  the setup file.

  The --sanitize and --no-sanitize switches are also gone, replaced with the
  htmlscrubber plugin. This plugin is enabled by default, to disable it,
  use --disable-plugin=htmlscrubber, or modify the plugin setting in the
  setup file.

  Discussion pages are enabled by default, but if your wiki is configured
  with a setup file, you need to edit it to keep them enabled on upgrade
  to this version. Add a line reading:
  discussion => 1,

  You will need to rebuild your wiki when upgrading to this version.
  If you listed your wiki in /etc/ikiwiki/wikilist this will be done
  automatically when the Debian package is upgraded. Or use
  ikiiki-mass-rebuild to force a rebuild.
