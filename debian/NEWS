ikiwiki (1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  The --svn and --no-svn switches are removed, instead you should use
   --rcs=svn or --no-rcs. ikiwiki setup files that set svn => 1 should
  be changed to set rcs => "svn"; if your setup file sets svn => 0
  then change it to use rcs => "" to disable svn.

  The --hyperestraier switch is gone too. To enable searching, turn on the
  search plugin, by passing --plugin=search or through the plugin setting in
  the config file.

  The --sanitize and --no-sanitize switches are also gone, replaced with the
  htmlscrubber plugin. This plugin is enabled by default, to disable it,
  use --disable-plugin=htmlscrubber, or modify the plugin setting in the
  config file.

  You will need to rebuild your wiki when upgrading to this version.
  If you listed your wiki in /etc/ikiwiki/wikilist this will be done
  automatically.
