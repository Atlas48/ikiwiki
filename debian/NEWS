ikiwiki (1.47) unstable; urgency=low
 
  Due to a security fix, wikis that have the htmlscrubber enabled can no
  longer use the meta plugin to insert html link and meta tags.

  Some special case methods have been added for safely including stylesheets,
  and for doing openid delegation. See the meta plugin docs for details.

  in /etc/ikiwiki/wikilist this will be done automatically when the Debian

ikiwiki (1.44) unstable; urgency=low

  The htmllink() function has changed slightly and plugins that use it may
  need to change how they call it. This function's first three parameters
  are unchanged, but additional options are now passed using named
  parameters. If you used htmllink with more than 3 parameters, you will
  need to change it. The plugin interface version has been increased to 1.02
  to reflect this change.

ikiwiki (1.42) unstable; urgency=low

  The anonok setting in config files has been removed. To enable
  httpauth support on your wiki, you should now enable the anonok plugin,
  instead.

  Third-party plugins that use pagespec_match() should be updated to pass
  the new third parameter (from) to that function. This is needed for the
  new relative glob matching to work.

ikiwiki (1.34) unstable; urgency=low

  The httpauth setting in config files has been removed. To enable
  httpauth support on your wiki, you should now enable the httpauth plugin,
  instead.

  This release includes OpenID support that is enabled through the openid
  plugin. I recommend turning this on to make it easier for users to sign
  in to your wiki.

ikiwiki (1.32) unstable; urgency=low

  There is a change to the plugin interface in this version. Any plugins that
  modify data in %links should pass scan => 1 when registering the hook that
  does so.

  Wikis need to be rebuilt on upgrade to this version. If you listed your wiki
  in /etc/ikiwiki/wikilist this will be done automatically when the Debian
  package is upgraded. Or use ikiwiki-mass-rebuild to force a rebuild.

  There is a change to the plugin interface in this version. Plugins that use
  %renderedfiles will need to be updated, as the hash's values are now arrays
  of rendered files. Plugins that cause a page to render additional files
  should use the new will_render function to register the files.

  Due to some changes in the CSS, wikis should be rebuilt on upgrade to this
  version. If you listed your wiki in /etc/ikiwiki/wikilist this will be done
  automatically when the Debian package is upgraded. Or use ikiwiki-mass-rebuild
  to force a rebuild.

  If you have modified versions of ikiwiki's html templates, you will need
  to update your templates to link to the stylesheet file using
  "<TMPL_VAR BASEURL>style.css" instead of the old method which used
  STYLEURL.

  There have also been some changes to the plugin interface:
  Any plugins that use santize, htmlize, or format hooks will need to be
  updated for this version of ikiwiki since these hooks have been changed
  to use named parameters.

ikiwiki (1.13) unstable; urgency=low

  The GlobList format which was used for specifiying sets of pages, has been
  replaced with a new, more expressive PageSpec format. While GlobLists will
  continue to work, that format is deprecated, and you are encouraged to use
  PageSpecs from now on, and also to change any GlobLists in your wiki to
  PageSpecs. See the new PageSpec page for details.
  
  You will need to rebuild your wiki when upgrading to this version. If you

ikiwiki (1.11) unstable; urgency=low

  Some changes to tags in this release, due to a new tag plugin. If you have
  been using the meta plugin to tag pages, you'll want to enable the tag
  plugin too, and change things like this:

  [[meta link="foobar"]]

  To this:

  [[tag foobar]]

  The new tags will appear at page footers, and are also easier to type.

  There have also been some changes to the plugin interface, particularly the
  interface of pagetemplate hooks has changed. See the changelog for details.

ikiwiki (1.8) unstable; urgency=low

  If your wiki is configured with a setup file, you should modify it to
  stop setting the "plugin" list directly, and instead add or remove plugins
  via the add_plugins and disable_plugins lines. For example, if you had:

  	plugin => [qw{inline smiley search}],

  Change it to these lines, which disables the default htmlscrubber plugin
  and adds the two additional plugins:

  	add_plugins => [qw{smiley search}],
  	disable_plugins => [qw{htmlscrubber}],

  Making this change makes your ikiwiki setup file more future-proof since
  new default plugins will be automatically used.
  
  You will need to rebuild your ikiwiki wrappers when upgrading to this
  version. If you listed your wiki in /etc/ikiwiki/wikilist this will be
  done automatically when the Debian package is upgraded. Or use
  ikiiki-mass-rebuild --refresh to force a refresh.

ikiwiki (1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  There have been several configuration changes in this release of ikiwiki:

  The --svn and --no-svn switches are removed, instead you should use
   --rcs=svn or --no-rcs. ikiwiki setup files that set svn => 1 should
  be changed to set rcs => "svn"; if your setup file sets svn => 0
  then change it to use rcs => "" to disable svn.

  The --hyperestraier switch is gone too. To enable searching, turn on the
  search plugin, by passing --plugin=search or through the plugin setting in
  the setup file.

  The --sanitize and --no-sanitize switches are also gone, replaced with the
  htmlscrubber plugin. This plugin is enabled by default, to disable it,
  use --disable-plugin=htmlscrubber, or modify the plugin setting in the
  setup file.

  Discussion pages are enabled by default, but if your wiki is configured
  with a setup file, you need to edit it to keep them enabled on upgrade
  to this version. Add a line reading:
  discussion => 1,

  You will need to rebuild your wiki when upgrading to this version.
  If you listed your wiki in /etc/ikiwiki/wikilist this will be done
  automatically when the Debian package is upgraded. Or use
  ikiiki-mass-rebuild to force a rebuild.
