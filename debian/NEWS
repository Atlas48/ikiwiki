ikiwiki (1.8) unstable; urgency=low

  If your wiki is configured with a setup file, you should modify it to
  stop setting the "plugin" list directly, and instead add or remove plugins
  via the add_plugins and disable_plugins lines. For example, if you had:

  	plugin => [qw{inline smiley search}],

  Change it to these lines, which disables the default htmlscrubber plugin
  and adds the two additional plugins:

  	add_plugins => [qw{smiley search}],
  	disable_plugins => [qw{htmlscrubber}],

  Making this change makes your ikiwiki setup file more future-proof since
  new default plugins will be automatically used.
  
  You will need to rebuild your wiki when upgrading to this version.
  If you listed your wiki in /etc/ikiwiki/wikilist this will be done
  automatically when the Debian package is upgraded. Or use
  ikiiki-mass-rebuild to force a rebuild.

ikiwiki (1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  There have been several configuration changes in this release of ikiwiki:

  The --svn and --no-svn switches are removed, instead you should use
   --rcs=svn or --no-rcs. ikiwiki setup files that set svn => 1 should
  be changed to set rcs => "svn"; if your setup file sets svn => 0
  then change it to use rcs => "" to disable svn.

  The --hyperestraier switch is gone too. To enable searching, turn on the
  search plugin, by passing --plugin=search or through the plugin setting in
  the setup file.

  The --sanitize and --no-sanitize switches are also gone, replaced with the
  htmlscrubber plugin. This plugin is enabled by default, to disable it,
  use --disable-plugin=htmlscrubber, or modify the plugin setting in the
  setup file.

  Discussion pages are enabled by default, but if your wiki is configured
  with a setup file, you need to edit it to keep them enabled on upgrade
  to this version. Add a line reading:
  discussion => 1,

  You will need to rebuild your wiki when upgrading to this version.
  If you listed your wiki in /etc/ikiwiki/wikilist this will be done
  automatically when the Debian package is upgraded. Or use
  ikiiki-mass-rebuild to force a rebuild.
