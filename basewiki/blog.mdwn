You can turn any page on this wiki into a weblog by inserting a
[[PreProcessorDirective]]. Like this:

	\\[[inline pages="blog/* !*/Discussion" show="10" rootpage="blog"]]

Any pages that match the specified [[GlobList]] (in the example, any
[[SubPage]] of "blog") will be part of the blog, and the newest 10
of them will appear in the page.

The optional `rootpage` parameter tells the wiki that new posts to this blog
should default to being [[SubPage]]s of "blog", and enables a form at the
top of the blog that can be used to add new items.

There is also an optional `rss` parameter that can control whether an RSS
feed is generated. The default is to generate an RSS feed, if the wiki is
globally configured to do so, but you can set `rss=no` to disable this.

If you want your blog to have an archive page listing every post ever made
to it, you can accomplish that like this:

	\\[[inline pages="blog/* !*/Discussion" archive="yes"]]

You can even create an automatically generated list of all the pages on the
wiki, with the most recently added at the top, like this:

	\\[[inline pages="* !*/Discussion" archive="yes"]]

If you want to be able to add pages to a given blog feed by tagging them,
you can do that too. To tag a page, just make it link to a page or pages 
that represent its tags. Then use the special link() [[GlobList]] to match
all pages that have a given tag:

	\\[[inline pages="link(life)"]]

Or include some tags and exclude others:

	\\[[inline pages="link(debian) !link(social)"]]
