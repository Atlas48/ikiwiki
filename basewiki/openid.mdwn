[[meta title="OpenID"]]

[OpenID](http://openid.net) is a decentralized authentication mechanism
that allows you to have one login that you can use on a growing number of
websites.

To sign up for an OpenID, visit one of the following identity providers:

* [MyOpenID](https://www.myopenid.com/)
* [GetOpenID](https://getopenid.com/)
* [Videntity](http://videntity.org/)
* [LiveJournal](http://www.livejournal.com/openid/)
* or any of the many others out there..

Your OpenID is the URL that you are given when you sign up. To sign in to
this wiki using OpenID, just enter it in the OpenID field in the signin
form. (If the field does not appear, OpenID signin is disabled.) You do not
need to give this wiki a password or go through any registration process
when using OpenID.

It's also possible to make a page in the wiki usable as an OpenID url,
by delegating it to an openid server. Here's an example of how to do that:

	\[[meta link="http://www.myopenid.com/server" rel="openid.server"]]
	\[[meta link="http://yourid.myopenid.com/" rel="openid.delegate"]]
