[[meta title="OpenID"]]

[OpenID](http://openid.net) is a decentralized authentication mechanism
that allows you to have one login that you can use on a growing number of
websites.

To sign up for an OpenID, visit one of the following identity providers:

* [MyOpenID](http://www.myopenid.com/)
* [GetOpenID](https://getopenid.com/)
* [LiveJournal](http://www.livejournal.com/openid/)
* or any of the many others out there..

To sign in to this wiki using OpenID, just enter it in the OpenID field in
the signin form. (If the field does not appear, OpenID signin is
disabled.) You do not need to give this wiki a password or go through any
registration process when using OpenID.
