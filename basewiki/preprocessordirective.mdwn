Preprocessor directives are similar to a [[WikiLink]] in form, except they
contain spaces and parameters. The general form is:

\\[[directive param="value" param="value"]]

This gets expanded before the rest of the page is processed, and can be used
to transform the page in various ways.

The quotes around values can be omitted if the value is a simple word.
Also, some directives may use parameters without values, for example:

\\[[tag foo]]

Note that if a preprocessor directive has no parameters, a space still must
be put after its name, to avoid confusion with a [[WikiLink]]. For example:

\\[[pagecount ]]
