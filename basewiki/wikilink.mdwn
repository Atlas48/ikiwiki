WikiLinks provide easy linking between pages of the wiki. To create a
[[WikiLink]], just put the name of the page to link to in double brackets.
For example "\[[WikiLink]]".

If you ever need to write something like "\[[WikiLink]] without creating a
wikilink, just prefix it with a "\", like "\\\\[[WikiLink]]".

Note that there are some special [[SubPage/LinkingRules]] that come into
play when linking between [[SubPage]]s.

WikiLinks can be entered in any case you like, the page they link to is
always lowercased.

Note that if the file linked to by a WikiLink looks like an image, it will
be displayed inline on the page.

It's also possible to write a WikiLink that uses something other than the
page name as the link text. For example "\[[foo bar|SandBox]]" links to the
SandBox page, but the link will appear like this: [[foo bar|SandBox]]
