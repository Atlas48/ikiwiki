WikiLinks provide easy linking between pages of the wiki. To create a
[[WikiLink]], just put the name of the page to link to in double brackets.
For example "\[[WikiLink]]".

If you ever need to write something like "\[[WikiLink]] without creating a
wikilink, just prefix it with a "\", like "\\\\[[WikiLink]]".

There are some special [[SubPage/LinkingRules]] that come into play when
linking between [[SubPages|SubPage]].

Also, if the file linked to by a WikiLink looks like an image, it will
be displayed inline on the page.

WikiLinks are matched with page names in a case-insensative manner, so you
don't need to worry about getting the case the same, and can capitalise
links at the start of a sentence, and so on.

It's also possible to write a WikiLink that uses something other than the
page name as the link text. For example "\[[foo_bar|SandBox]]" links to the
SandBox page, but the link will appear like this: [[foo_bar|SandBox]]
