In QA work you're always comparing revisions. There's no difference
between dealing with versions which skipped the archive because they
were QAed elsewhere, or versions which are no longer in the archive
because they have been superseded. Furthemore, in this case, there was
an upload, it just never made it out of NEW.

There's a significant difference between uploads to mentors.d.n and
uploads to debian.org. If you actually uploaded to the archive, even
if it never made it out of NEW, you should never elide changelogs.
