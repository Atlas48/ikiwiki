Sure it does. It tells end users what was changed in between the
REJECT and the new upload. Eliding this means that it's no longer
possible to trivially tell what was changed between uploads.[1]

There were two uploaded, not just one. Furthermore, it doesn't matter
how many have reached the archive when a user is examining changelogs.
All you care about is the version that you have, the version that
you're upgrading to, and any previous versions you had installed. None
of those necessarily correlate with versions that are actually in the
archive.

Obviously, which is why you should do what I suggested.

You shouldn't treat changelogs of packages which happen to stop off at
NEW any differently, even if they get REJECTed.

1: Furthermore, you really should be tagging your uploads with the
release that you uploaded to Debian with in your VCS. You are doing
that, right?
