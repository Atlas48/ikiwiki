But does really an end user knows/cares about it? You are talkink from
a developer POV, that's a little bit low-level than most of our users.

mh, so the latest changelog entry should report why the previous
upload was REJECTED, and what was done to fix it.

I suggest this only because a REJECTED package is a sort of
half-release, and you still need to rework (hopefully a bit) the
previous changes: you rework the previous upload (that you think it
was right) to meet our standards.

Of course, this is just what I *feel* is correct, since no ufficial
doc is available for this.

Cheers,
Sandro

Of course, but I can retag ;)
