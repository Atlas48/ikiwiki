The `pagecount` directive is supplied by the [[!iki plugins/pagecount]] plugin.

This directive counts pages currently in the wiki.

The optional parameter "pages" can be a [[ikiwiki/PageSpec]] specifying the
pages to count, default is to count them all.

If it is turned on it can tell us that this wiki includes
[[!pagecount pages="* and !recentchanges"]]
pages, of which [[!pagecount pages="*/Discussion"]] are discussion pages.
