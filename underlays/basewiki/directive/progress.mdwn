The `progress` directive is supplied by the [[!iki plugins/progress]] plugin.

This directive generates a progress bar.

There are two possible parameter sets.  The first is a single parameter
"percent" which holds a percentage figure of how complete the progress bar is.

The second possible set of parameters is a pair of [[ikiwiki/PageSpec]]s,
`totalpages` and `donepages`.  The progress plugin counts the number of
pages in each pagespec and shows the percentage of the total pages that are
done.

This plugin is included in ikiwiki, but is not enabled by default.

If it is turned on it can show what percentage of pages have discussion pages:

[[!progress totalpages="* and !*/Discussion" donepages="*/Discussion"]]
