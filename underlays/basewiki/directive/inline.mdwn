The `inline` directive is supplied by the [[!iki plugins/inline]] plugin.

This is a [[ikiwiki/directive]] that allows including one wiki page
inside another. For example:

	\[[!inline pages="blog/*"]]

The most common use of inlining is generating blogs and RSS or Atom feeds.
See [[ikiwiki/blog]] for details.
