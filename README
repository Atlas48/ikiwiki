Use ./Makefile.PL to generate a Makefile, "make" will build the
documentation wiki and a man page, and "make install" will install ikiwiki.

A few special variables you can set while using the Makefile:

PROFILE=1 turns on profiling for the build of the doc wiki. Uses Devel::Profile

NOTAINT=1 turns off the taint flag in the ikiwiki program. (Recommended
unless your perl is less buggy than mine -- see
http://bugs.debian.org/411786)

All other documentation is in the ikiwiki documentation wiki, which is also
available online at <http://ikiwiki.info/>
