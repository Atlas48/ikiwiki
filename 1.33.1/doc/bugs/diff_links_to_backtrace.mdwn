The diff links in RecentChanges go to a viewcvs backtrace if the rev in 
question is when the page was added. Is this a viewcvs bug, or a behavior 
ikiwiki needs to work around?
  - As a special case, there should certianly be no history link for
    pages generated from the underlaydir as it can never work for them.
