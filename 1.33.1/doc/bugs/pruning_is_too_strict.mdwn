ikiwiki compiles my wiki successfully. But the svn post-commit hook it installs doesn't work at all. Instead of rendering the files, it deletes their rendered versions. The reason is that the src directory, /home/.kelli/glasserc/wikiwc, matches the prune regexp, so no files in the wiki get added to @files.

I think the prune regexp would be more useful if it was only used to check the relative path from the src root to a file in the wiki.
