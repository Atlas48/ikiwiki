Very neat. The warnings about it not being very secure are of course spot on.
Seems that the need to embed the api key on the page is a security problem of one sort. 

The call to gpsbabel _seems_ secure thanks to the sanitisation done to the filename passed to gpsbabel.

I probably won't ever add this to ikiwiki, but it's a great third-party plugin!
