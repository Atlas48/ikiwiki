[[tag type/tags type/link]]

This plugin allows tagging pages. List tags as follows:

	\[[tag tech life linux]]

The tags work the same as if you had put a (hidden) [[WikiLink]] on the page
for each tag, so you can use a [[PageSpec]] match all pages that are
tagged with a given tag, for example. The tags will also show up on blog
entries and at the bottom of the tagged pages, as well as in RSS and Atom
feeds.

This plugin has a configuration option. Set --tagbase=tag and links to tags
will be located under the specified base page. If ikiwiki is configured
this way, then the example above actually tags the page with the tags
tags/tech, tags/life, and tags/linux. This is a useful way to avoid
having to write the full path to tags, if you want to keep them grouped
together out of the way.

If this plugin is enabled, you'll see a note below that this page is tagged
with the "tags" tag.
