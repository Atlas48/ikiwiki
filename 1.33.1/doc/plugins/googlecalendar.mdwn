This plugin allows embedding a google calendar iframe in the wiki.
Normally, if the [[htmlscrubber]] is enabled, such iframes are scrubbed out
of the wiki content since they're not very safe if created by malicious
users. But some iframes are legitimate, and safe, if you trust the embedded
content. This plugin is an example of how to deal with this in ikiwiki.

Example use:

	\[[googlecalendar html="""
	<iframe src="http://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=adkrdken8mupngh13jshlbenoc%40group.calendar.google.com&title=OSEL%20Calendar&chrome=NAVIGATION&bgcolor=%2371d873&height=588" style=" border-width:0 " width="480" frameborder="0"	height="588"></iframe>
	"""]]

The iframe should be the one provided by google. Note that it's used in a
way that avoids cross-site scripting attacks, assuming you trust google's
content.
