ikiwiki 1.31 released with these changes:

   * Patch from Pawel Tecza to cp -a the templates in the Makefile.
   * Change the rss feed title from the wikiname to the page title, with
     an exception for the wiki's toplevel index page, which will still use the
     wikiname as the feed title.
     Overriding the page title with meta title already overrode the rss feed
     tittle.
   * Add an img plugin, based on Christian Mock's img plugin, but stripped
     down to the bare essentials. Useful for handling large images on websites.
   * Sanitize possibly problimatic characters out of the polygen grammar names,
     just in case. Should not be exploitable anyway, since it only tries to run
     polygen after finding the specified grammar file.
   * Add missing dependency on the URI perl module.
   * Add basic spam fighting tool for admins: An admin's prefs page now allows
     editing a list of banned users.
