ikiwiki 1.30 released with these changes:

   * Add no\_override parameter to hook().
   * Add a shortcut plugin, inspired by Victor Moral's contributed shortcuts
     plugin, but featuring a more ikiwiki-ish syntax and with shortcuts that
     can be configured using a page in wiki.
   * Fix support for --pingurl at the command line.
   * Fix a subtle bug in will\_render that broke some builds, by only clearing
     items from renderedfiles the first time per build.
   * Wrap entire technortati ping operation in an eval to catch all possible
     failure modes, after I observed a simple -&gt;value crashing ikiwiki when
     a ping failed.
