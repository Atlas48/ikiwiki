To link to or from a [[SubPage]], you can normally use a regular
[[WikiLink]] that does not contain the name of the parent directory of
the [[SubPage]]. Ikiwiki descends the directory hierarchy looking for a
page that matches your link.

For example, if FooBar/SubPage links to "OtherPage", ikiwiki will first 
prefer pointing the link to FooBar/SubPage/OtherPage if it exists, next
to FooBar/OtherPage and finally to OtherPage in the root of the wiki.

Note that this means that if a link on FooBar/SomePage to "OtherPage"
currently links to OtherPage, in the root of the wiki, and FooBar/OtherPage
is created, the link will _change_ to point to FooBar/OtherPage. On the
other hand, a link from BazBar to "OtherPage" would be unchanged by this
creation of a [[SubPage]] of FooBar.

You can also specify a link that contains a directory name, like
"FooBar/OtherPage" to more exactly specify what page to link to. This is
the only way to link to an unrelated [[SubPage]].

You can use this to, for example, to link from BazBar to "FooBar/SubPage",
or from BazBar/SubPage to "FooBar/SubPage".
