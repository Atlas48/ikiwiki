* tag 0.3
  - fix link to mailbox.css
  - you can now just add you mbox as foo.mbox (MH and Maildir are 
  more problematic) and have it htmlify

* tag 0.2
  - put back loadplugin of filecheck, without which everything fails
  weirdly.

  - document dependency on patched filecheck

* tag 0.1

  - kinda sorta working.
  - HTML attachement handling could be improved. Most text/html 
  are deleted by default. Bad html is recognized as text/plain.
