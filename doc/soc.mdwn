List of Projects
================

This list includes pages, such as [[/todo]] items, tagged `soc`.  If you have a great idea for an ikiwiki project not on this list, please file it as a todo item, and ask us if it might work as a Summer of Code project, but please don't add the `soc` tag yourself.
