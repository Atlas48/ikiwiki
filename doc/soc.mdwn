[[meta title="Summer of Code"]]

This page includes information about ikiwiki's involvement in
[Google Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/soc/).

We started with a list of [[ideas]]. Our [[application]] was accepted, and
the following projects will be worked on:

* latex plugin input/output for ikiwiki  
  by Patrick Winnertz
* Implement File Upload Functionality and Image Gallery Creation  
  by Ben Coffey  
  (See [[todo/fileupload/soc-proposal]])
* Wiki WYSIWYG Editor  
  by Taylor Killian
* Creating a gallery of a bunch of images  
  by [[ArpitJain]]

Students working on these projects are encouraged to add links to any blogs,
patch repositories, etc that they will use.
