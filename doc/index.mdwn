ikiwiki is a **wiki compiler**. It converts wiki pages
into html pages suitable for publishing on a website. Unlike a traditional
wiki, ikiwiki does not have its own means of storing page history.
Instead it can use [[Subversion]] (or [[Git]]).

* [[News]] is a blog (built using ikiwiki) of news items about ikiwiki. It's the best way to find out when there's a new version to [[Download]].

* See [[Features]] for a list of ikiwiki's features. [[RoadMap]], [[TODO]] and [[bugs]] might also be of interest. Feel free to post your thoughts about ikiwiki to [[Discussion]].

* [[Setup]] has a tutorial for setting up ikiwiki, and [[Usage]] documents the parameters and usage of the ikiwiki program. If you use ikiwiki, please add your wiki to [[IkiWikiUsers]].

* [[Security]] lists potential security problems. ikiwiki is still being developed, and is being written with security as a priority, so don't expect things to stay in this list for long.

All wikis are supposed to have a [[SandBox]], so this one does too.

ikiwiki is developed by [[Joey]] and is [[FreeSoftware]].
