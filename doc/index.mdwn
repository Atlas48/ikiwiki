ikiwiki is a wiki compiler. It converts a directory full of wiki pages
into html pages suitable for publishing on a website. Unlike a traditional
wiki, ikiwiki does not have its own means of storing page history or its own
markup language. Instead it uses [[Subversion]] and [[MarkDown]].

* See [[Features]] for a current list of ikiwiki's features. 

* [[WhyIkiWiki]] might be useful if you're considering using this.

* [[Setup]] has a tutorial for setting up ikiwki.

* [[TODO]] and bugs lists things that need to be added to ikiwiki before most people would consider it a full-fledged wiki.

* [[Security]] lists potential security problems. ikiwiki is still being developed, and is being written with security as a priority, don't expect things to stay in this list for long.

Ikiwiki is _not_ yet formally realeased. If you really have to have it, <svn://svn.kitenet.net/ikiwiki/trunk>

All wikis are supposed to have a [[SandBox]], so this one does to.

ikiwiki is developed by [[Joey]].
