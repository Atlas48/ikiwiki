ikiwiki is a wiki compiler. It converts a directory full of wiki pages
into html pages suitable for publishing on a website. Unlike a traditional
wiki, ikiwiki does not have its own means of storing page history, its own
markup language, or support for editing pages online. 

To use ikiwiki to set up a wiki, you will probably want to use it with a
revision control system, such as [[Subversion]], for keeping track of past
versions of pages. ikiwiki can run as a Subversion [[post-commit]] hook, so
that each committed change to your wiki is immediatly compiled and
published.

See [[Features]] for a current list of ikiwiki's features. [[WhyIkiWiki]]
might be useful if you're considering using this.

[[Setup]] has a tutorial for setting up ikiwki.

[[TODO]] lists things that need to be added to ikiwiki before most people
would consider it a full-fledged wiki.

All wikis are supposed to have a [[SandBox]], so this one does to.

ikiwiki is developed by [[Joey]].
