ikiwiki is a **wiki compiler**. It converts wiki pages
into HTML pages suitable for publishing on a website. Unlike many
wikis, ikiwiki does not have its own ad-hoc means of storing page history,
and instead uses a revision control system such as [[Subversion]].

* [[News]] is a blog (built using ikiwiki) of news items about ikiwiki.
  It's the best way to find out when there's a new version to [[Download]].

* Ikiwiki has a nice set of wiki [[features]] which can be expanded by
  a large array of [[plugins]]. It also has some [[bugs]], a [[TODO]] list,
  and a [[RoadMap]].

[[Version_2.0|news/ikiwiki_version_2.0]] is now available.  
If you use ikiwiki, please list your wiki in [[IkiWikiUsers]].
Thanks! --[[Joey]]

* [[Setup]] has a tutorial for setting up ikiwiki, and [[Usage]] documents
  the parameters and usage of the ikiwiki program. There are some
  [[examples]] of things you can do with ikiwiki.

* Feel free to post your questions and thoughts about ikiwiki to
  [[Discussion]], or [[contact]] the developers.

* [[Security]] lists potential security problems. ikiwiki is still being
  developed, and is being written with security as a priority, so don't
  expect things to stay in this list for long.

* Developers, please document any ikiwiki patches you have in the
  [[PatchQueue]].

All wikis are supposed to have a [[SandBox]], so this one does too.

ikiwiki is developed by [[Joey]] and is [[FreeSoftware]].
