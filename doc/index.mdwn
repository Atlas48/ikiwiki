ikiwiki is a wiki compiler. It converts a directory full of wiki pages
into html pages suitable for publishing on a website. Unlike a traditional
wiki, ikiwiki does not have its own means of storing page history or its own
markup language. Instead it uses [[Subversion]] and [[MarkDown]].

* [[News]] is a blog (built using ikiwiki) of news items about ikiwiki. It's the best way to find out when there's a new version to [[Download]].

* See [[Features]] for a current list of ikiwiki's features. [[TODO]] and [[bugs]] might also be of interest.

* [[Setup]] has a tutorial for setting up ikiwki, and [[Usage]] documents the parameters and usage of the ikiwiki program.

* [[Security]] lists potential security problems. ikiwiki is still being developed, and is being written with security as a priority, so don't expect things to stay in this list for long.

All wikis are supposed to have a [[SandBox]], so this one does too.

ikiwiki is developed by [[Joey]] and is [[FreeSoftware]].
