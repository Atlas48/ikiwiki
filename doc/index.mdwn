ikiwiki is a wiki compiler. It converts a directory full of wiki pages
into html pages suitable for publishing on a website. Unlike a traditional
wiki, ikiwiki does not have its own means of storing page history, its own
markup language, or support for editing pages online. 

To use ikiwiki to set up a wiki, you will probably want to use it with a
revision control system, such as [[Subversion]], for keeping track of past
versions of pages. ikiwiki can run as a Subversion [[post-commit]] hook, so
that each committed change to your wiki is immediatly compiled and
published.

See [[Features]] for a current list of ikiwiki's features. [[WhyIkiWiki]]
might be useful if you're considering using this.

[[Subversion]] also offers a way to let others edit pages on your wiki.
Just configure subversion to let appropriate users (or everyone) commit to
the wiki's repository. There are some things you should keep in mind about
[[Security]] when allowing the world to edit your ikiwiki.

ikiwiki also supports files of any other type, including raw html, text,
images, etc. These are not converted to wiki pages, they are just copied
unchanged by ikiwiki as it builds your wiki. So you can check in an image,
program, or other special file and link to it from your wiki pages.
ikiwiki also supports making one page that is a [[SubPage]] of another.

[[Setup]] has a tutorial for setting up ikiwki.

[[TODO]] lists things that need to be added to ikiwiki before most people
would consider it a full-fledged wiki.

All wikis are supposed to have a [[SandBox]], so this one does to.

ikiwiki is developed by [[Joey]].
