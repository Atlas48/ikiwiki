## branches

You are of course free to set up your own ikiwiki git repository with your
own [[patches|patch]].

Some of the branches included in the main repository include:

* `gallery` contains the [[todo/Gallery]] plugin. It's not yet merged
  due to license issues.  Also some bits need to be tweaked to make it
  work with the current *master* branch again.
* `html` is an unfinished attempt at making ikiwiki output HTML 4.01
  instead of xhtml.
* `wikiwyg` adds [[todo/wikiwyg]] support. It is unmerged pending some
  changes.
* `pristine-tar` contains deltas that
  [pristine-tar](http://kitenet.net/~joey/code/pristine-tar)
  can use to recreate released tarballs of ikiwiki
* `debian-stable` is used for updates to the old version included in
  Debian's stable release.
