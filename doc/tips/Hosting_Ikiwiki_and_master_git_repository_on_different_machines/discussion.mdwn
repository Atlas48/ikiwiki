It may be clear to experienced/technical gitolite users, but it confused me so I'd like to ask:

In the comment about gitolite mentioning the line with $GL_USER, I assume "gitolite-user"  
needs to be replaced with the name of the gitolite user with which ikiwiki pushes  
changes? For example, if I have a key 'ikiwiki.pub', I use "ikiwiki" in the hook.

If that's what the comment means, I'd be happy if it was made clear, so it's easier  
to understand. Or I can edit it myself, once I make sure I really understand.
