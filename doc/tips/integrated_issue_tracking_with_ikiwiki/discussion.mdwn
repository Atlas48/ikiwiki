Just wondering, who's using ikiwiki as their bug-tracking system?  I'm trying to root out bug-tracking systems that work with GIT and so far like ikiwiki for docs, but haven't yet figured out the best way to make it work for bug-tracking.

I suppose having a separate branch for public web stuff w/ the following workflow makes sense:

* Separate master-web and master branches
* master-web is public
* cherry-pick changes from master-web into master when they are sane
* regularly merge master -> master-web

Bug origination point: ... anybody have ideas for this?  Create branch at bug origination point and merge into current upstream branches?  (I guess this would be where cherry-picking would work best, since the web UI can't do this)

Bug naming: any conventions/ideas on how to standardize?  Any suggestions on methods of linking commits to bugs without having to modify the bug in each commit?
