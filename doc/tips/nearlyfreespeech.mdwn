[NearlyFreeSpeech.net](http://NearlyFreeSpeech.net) is a shared hosting
provider with very cheap pay as you go pricing. Here's how to install ikiwiki
there if you don't have a dedicated server.

* [Get an account](https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/about/start.php).
* Create a site using their web interface. Mine is named `ikiwiki-test` and I
  used their DNS instead of getting my own, resulting in
  <http://ikiwiki-test.nfshost.com/>
* Fund it. (Or don't. They gave me 2 cents free funding for signing up, which
  is enough to pay for 10 megabytes of hosting, or about a thousand typical 
  page views at their current rates.)
* `ssh` into their server using the ssh hostname and username displayed on
  the site's information page. For me this was

	ssh joeyh_ikiwiki-test@ssh.phx.nearlyfreespeech.net

* Set up .profile to use your home directory.

	echo "PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin" > $HOME/.profile
	. $HOME/.profile

* You'll be in the htdocs directory by default, where public web pages are
  put, so before installing ikiwiki, `cd $HOME`
* Use `wget` to [[download]] the ikiwiki tarball.
* Unpack ikiwiki.

	tar zxvf ikiwiki*.tar.gz

* Use CPAN to install the perl modules it uses into your home directory:
  (This will take a while. As long as the first command succeeds, ikiwiki will be
  usable. The second command adds extra modules that some plugins use, and
  installation of some of them might fail.)

	PERL5LIB=ikiwiki:ikiwiki/cpan:. PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT=1 perl -MCPAN -e 'CPAN::Shell->install("Bundle::IkiWiki")'
	PERL5LIB=ikiwiki:ikiwiki/cpan:. PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT=1 perl -MCPAN -e 'CPAN::Shell->force(install => "Bundle::IkiWiki::Extras")'

* Now build and install ikiwiki into your home directory.

	cd ikiwiki
	export MAKE=gmake
	perl Makefile.PL INSTALL_BASE=$HOME PREFIX=
	$MAKE
	$MAKE install

* With ikiwiki installed, you can follow the regular [[setup]] tutorial for
  settng up your wiki. Make sure to set `destdir` to `/home/htdocs/` so that
  the wiki is published on the web site. I recommend using git for revision
  control; you can then clone your wiki's git repository as an offsite backup.
  Here is an example of how I set up a wiki:

	mkdir ~/wiki
	cd ~/wiki
	cp ~/ikiwiki/doc/ikiwiki.setup .
	cp -r ~/ikiwiki/doc/examples/blog/* .
	nano ikiwiki.setup
	# Set destdir to /home/htdocs
	# Set srcdir to /home/private/wiki
	# Set url to http://yoursite.nfshost.com/ , set cgiurl likewise
	# Uncomment the `rcs => "git"` line, and the cgi and git
	# post-update wrapper blocks.
	# Set the cgi wrapper path to /home/htdocs/ikiwiki.cgi
	# Set the git wrapper path to /home/private/wiki.git/hooks/post-update
	# Configure the rest to your liking and save the file.
	ikiwiki-makerepo git . ../wiki.git
	ikiwiki -setup ikiwiki.setup

* Finally, you can save a _lot_ of disk space by cleaning up the ikiwiki
  tarball and .cpan directory.

	rm -rf ~/ikiwiki*.tar.gz ~/.cpan

Have fun and do good things. --[[Joey]]
