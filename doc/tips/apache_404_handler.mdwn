[[!meta title="Apache 404 handler"]]

Sufficiently recent versions of IkiWiki can be used as an Apache 404 handler,
to give the behaviour of various other wiki engines where visiting a
nonexistent page provides you with a link to create it.

To achieve this, put something like this in the wiki's Apache configuration
file:

    ErrorDocument 404 /cgi-bin/ikiwiki.cgi?do=goto
