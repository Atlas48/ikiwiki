Would it work if the mirrored wiki was configured with cgiurl set to the cgiurl of the origin wiki - so that users were seamlessly redirected to the origin for edits? --[[Jamie]]

>>> I still don't understand the difference, and I can't reach the URL you have given above. Previously, to upload stuff I created a clone of the git repository and asked joeyh to pull, like [[this|todo/improve_decentralised_wikis_documentation_and_graphics/]]. --[[anarcat]]

>>>> Difference between *Separate webserver and git repository* and *Separate ikiwiki web server, and git server* : the only difference is that in the first case, the git srcdir is on the same server as the git main repository, whereas in the second case, it is present on the same server as the web server. One use case is when one as a very limited access to the server hosting the git repository, and cannot setup the git srcdir (because of, for instance, a (reasonably?) paranoid sysadmins would require the creation of a new user to own the git srcdir).
