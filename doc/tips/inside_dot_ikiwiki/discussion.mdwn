My database appears corrupted:

    $ perl -le 'use Storable; my $index=Storable::retrieve("indexdb"); use Data::Dumper; print Dumper $index'
    Out of memory!

No idea how this happened.  I've blown it away and recreated it but, for future reference, is there any less violent way to recover from this situation?  I miss having the correct created and last edited times.  --[[sabr]]
