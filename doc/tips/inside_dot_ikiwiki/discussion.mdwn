My database appears corrupted:

    $ perl -le 'use Storable; my $index=Storable::retrieve("indexdb"); use Data::Dumper; print Dumper $index'
    Out of memory!

No idea how this happened.  I've blown it away and recreated it but, for future reference, is there any less violent way to recover from this situation?  I miss having the correct created and last edited times.  --[[sabr]]

>> --getctime appears to only set the last edited date.  It's not supposed to set the creation date, is it?  The only place that info is stored is in the git repo.
