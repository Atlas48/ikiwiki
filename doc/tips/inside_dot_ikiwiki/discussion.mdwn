My database appears corrupted:

    $ perl -le 'use Storable; my $index=Storable::retrieve("indexdb"); use Data::Dumper; print Dumper $index'
    Out of memory!

No idea how this happened.  I've blown it away and recreated it but, for future reference, is there any less violent way to recover from this situation?  I miss having the correct created and last edited times.  --[[sabr]]

>> --getctime only appears to set the last edited date, not the creation date.  It's not supposed to set the creation date, is it?  The only place that info is stored is in the git repo.  I seem to have lost the bad index file to periodic /tmp wiping; I'll send it to you if it happens again.  --[[sabr]]
