These are some notes on installing ikiwiki on Mac OS X Snow Leopard. I have a three year old machine with a lot of stuff on it so it took quite a while, YMMV. 

The best part of installing ikiwiki was learning how to use git. I never used source control before but its pretty slick.


## installing git:

cd /opt/ikiwiki/install

curl http://kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/git-(latest version).tar.gz -O

tar xzvf git-(latest version).tar.gz

cd git-(latest version)

./configure --prefix=/usr/local 

make prefix=/usr/local all

sudo make install


git config --global user.name "firstname lastname" 

git config --global user.email "email here"

git config --global color.ui "auto" 


curl http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/git-manpages-1.7.3.1.tar.gz | sudo tar -xzC /usr/local/share/man/


## installing ikiwiki:
I had terrible trouble installing ikiwiki. It turned out I had accidentally installed Perl through ports. Uninstalling that made everything install nicely.
I got an error on msgfmt. Turns out this is a program in gettext. I installed that and it fixed the error.

git clone git://git.ikiwiki.info/

perl Makefile.PL  LIB=/Library/Perl/5.10.0

make

sudo make install

when you make ikiwiki it gives you a .git folder with the ikiwiki files. Stay out of this folder. You want to learn how to create a clone and make all your changes in the clone. When you push the changes ikiwiki will update. I moved a file in this folder by accident because I named my working file the same and I couldn't get into the setup page. I had apparently messed up my ikiwiki git repository. I did a pull into my clone, deleted the repository and webserver/ cgi folders and ran a new setup. Then I did a git clone and dragged all my old files into the new clone. Did the git dance and did git push. Then the angels sang.


## using git from inside a git folder:

start with git clone, then learn to do the git dance like this.

git pull

make your changes to your clone

git commit -a -m "message here"

git push


When you can't get into the setup page or you get strange behavior after a setup update the Utilities > Console app is your friend.

## installing gitweb

cd gitweb

make GITWEB_PROJECTROOT="/opt/ikiwiki/" GITWEB_CSS="/gitweb/gitweb.css" GITWEB_LOGO="/gitweb/git-logo.png" GITWEB_FAVICON="/gitweb/git-favicon.png" 

cp gitweb.cgi /Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables/

sudo chmod 2755 /Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables/gitweb.cgi

## installing xapian:

download xapian and omega

I needed pcre: sudo ports install pcre

./configure

make

sudo make install


## installing omega:

I had a build error do to libiconv undefined symbols. sudo port deactivate libiconv took care of it. After install I had trouble with ikiwiki so I did a sudo port install libiconv and ikiwiki came back.

./configure

make

sudo make install


## installing Search::Xapian from CPAN

for some reason this wouldn't install using CPAN console so I went to CPAN online and downloaded the source.

perl Makefile.PL

make

make test

sudo make install

it installed without issue so I'm baffled why it didn't install from command line.


## turning on search plugin:

I turned on the plugin from the setup page in ikiwiki but it gave an error when I went to search. Error "blah blah cgi-bin/omega/omega" does not exist or some such. I did a 

find / -name "omega" -print

and found the omega program in 

/usr/local/lib/xapian-omega/bin/omega. 

Then I went into the setup file and replaced the bad path, updated and badda-boom badda-bing.
