The u32 page is excellent, but I wonder if documenting the procedure here
would be worthwhile. Who knows, the remote site might disappear. But also
there are some variations on the approach that might be useful:

 * using a python script and the dom library to extract the page names from
   Special:Allpages (such as
   <http://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/jon.dowland/unix/docs/get_pagenames.py>)
 * Or, querying the mysql back-end to get the names
 * using WWW::MediaWiki for importing/exporting pages from the wiki, instead
   of Special::Export

Also, some detail on converting mediawiki transclusion to ikiwiki inlines...
