Here's an example of how to run ikiwiki in a [[Subversion]] post-commit
hook to automatically update a wiki as commits come in:

	wiki_src=/path/to/checkout
	wiki_dest=/path/to/web/server
	svn up -q $wiki_src
	ikiwiki $wiki_src $wiki_dest --wikiname=MyWiki

This assumes that permissions allow anyone who commits to svn up the
wiki_src directory and write to wiki_dest. If they don't, you'll need a
suid wrapper to run the above as a user who can write to both.
