A dear [[wishlist]] which would resolve [[this question|forum/ikiwiki_and_big_files]]: ikiwiki should support git-annex repositories.

I am not sure how this would work, but from my POV, it should do a `git annex get` when new commits are pushed to its bare repo. This would assume, of course, that there's another repo somewhere that ikiwiki has access to, which works for HTTP-style remotes, but could be more problematic for SSH remotes that require a key.

Another solution would be to make ikiwiki a remote itself and allow users to push big files to it. The only problem I see with this is those files would end up in the bare repository and not necessarily show up in the web rendering. Ideally, a big file pushed would be hardlinked between the two repos, but it seems [git-annex doesn't support that yet](http://git-annex.branchable.com/todo/wishlist:_use_hardlinks_for_local_clones). --[[anarcat]]

First implementation
====================

So as the [[discussion]] shows, it seems it's perfectly possible to actually do this! There's this [gallery site](http://stockholm.kalleswork.net) which uses the [[plugins/contrib/album]] plugin and git-annex to manage its files.

The crucial steps are:

 1. setup a git annex remote in `$srcdir`

 2. configure direct mode because ikiwiki ignores symlinks for [[security]] reasons:

        cd $srcdir
        git annex init
        git annex direct

 3. configure files to be considered by git-annex (those will be not committed into git directly):

        git config annex.largefiles 'largerthan=100kb and not (include=*.mdwn or include=*.txt)'

 2. make the bare repository (the remote of `$srcdir`) ignored by git-annex:

        cd $srcdir
        git config remote.origin.annex-ignore true
        git config remote.origin.annex-sync false

    (!) This needs to be done on *ANY* clone of the repository, which is annoying, but it's important because we don't want to see git-annex stuff in the bare repo. (why?)

This assumes you know what `srcdir`, `repository` and so on mean, if you forgot (like me), see this reference: [[rcs/git/]].

What doesn't work
-----------------

With a recent version of git-annex: mostly everything. :) Since git-annex in `direct` mode now [sets the repository as bare](http://git-annex.branchable.com/devblog/day_48__direct_mode_guard_design/), *nothing* gets committed at all.

What would need to happen in ikiwiki would be to detect that `$srcdir` is running git-annex in direct mode and then do some magic. Here is a tentative incantation in shell:

    if [ $(git config core.bare) == 'true' ] &&
       [ $(git config annex.direct) == 'true' ]; then
        git annex add --auto
        git -c core.bare=false commit -m'testing git-annex with ikiwiki'
    fi

This probably needs to happen around line 571 of `git.pm` or, more likely, in a new `git-annex` plugin.

What remains to be clarified
----------------------------

 * how do files get pushed to the `$srcdir`? Only through the web interface?
 * why do we ignore the bare repository?

See the [[discussion]] for a followup on that. --[[anarcat]]
