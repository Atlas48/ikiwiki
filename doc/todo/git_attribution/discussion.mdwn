I'd strongly recommend this modification to ikiwiki.  Any particular limitations that anyone can think of?

I might even have a try at this patch, though I'd have to hack the user preferences page to include author name...

As to the question of whether the committer was the 'script' or the wiki editor... I'm not sure.  Marking it as the script somehow (`ikiwiki-cgi <ikiwiki@sitename>`)? seems to make sense and would make it easier to manage.
