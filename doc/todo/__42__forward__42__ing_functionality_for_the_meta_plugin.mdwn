Here is a patch [[tag patch]] to add a *forward*ing functionality
to the [[`meta`_plugin|plugins/meta]].

Find the most recent version at
<http://www.schwinge.homeip.net/~thomas/tmp/meta_forward.patch>.

I can't use `scrub(...)`, as that will strip out the forwarding HTML command.
How to deal with that?

I can also submit a Git patch, if desired.
