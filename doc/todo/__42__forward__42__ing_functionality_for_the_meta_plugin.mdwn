Here is a patch [[tag patch]] to add a *forward*ing functionality
to the [[`meta`_plugin|plugins/meta]].

Find the most recent version at
<http://www.schwinge.homeip.net/~thomas/tmp/meta_forward.patch>.

I can't use `scrub(...)`, as that will strip out the forwarding HTML command.
How to deal with that?

I can also submit a Git patch, if desired.


*Syntax:*

**URL** = http://some.nice/place/ (*etc.*)

**WHITHER** = \[\[**[[wikilink]]**]] | **URL**

**D** = natural number (*meaning seconds*)

**OPT_DELAY** = delay=**D** | empty (*immediatelly*)

\[[meta forward="*WHITHER*" *OPT_DELAY*]]
