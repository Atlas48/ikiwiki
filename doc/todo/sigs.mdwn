Need a way to sign name in page that's easier to type than "--\[[Joey]]"
and that includes the date.

What syntax do other wikis use for this? I'm considering "\[[--]]" (with
spaces removed) as it has a nice nmemonic.

OTOH, adding additional syntax for this would be counter to one of the
design goals for ikiwiki: keeping as much markup as possible out of the
wiki and not adding nonstandard markup. And it's not significantly hard to
type "--\[[Joey]]", and as to the date, we do have page history.

I'm also unsure how to possibly implement this. Seems ikiwiki would need to expand the rune to the user's name when a page is saved, but that leaves out svn commits.
