Need a way to sign name in page that's easier to type than "--\[[Joey]]"
and that includes the date.

What syntax do other wikis use for this? I'm considering "\[[--]]" (with
spaces removed) as it has a nice nmemonic.

OTOH, adding additional syntax for this would be counter to one of the
design goals for ikiwiki: keeping as much markup as possible out of the
wiki and not adding nonstandard markup. And it's not significantly hard to
type "--\[[Joey]]", and as to the date, we do have page history.
