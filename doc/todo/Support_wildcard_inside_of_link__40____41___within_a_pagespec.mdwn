I don't segregate my blog entries into a directory, but instead want
my blog to simply consist of all pages that have been tagged. That is,
I'd like to have my blog page look like this:

	\[[inline pages="link(tag/*)"]]

But I [tried](http://www.cworth.org/blog) that and it doesn't seem to
work in ikiwiki 2.1 at least.
