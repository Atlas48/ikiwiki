I thought I'd draw attention to a desire of mine for **ikiwiki**.  I'm no power-user, and mostly I do fairly simple stuff with my [wiki](http://kitenet.net/~kyle/family/wiki).

However, I would like the ability (now) to **rename/move/delete** pages.  As part of having a genealogy wiki, I've put name and dates of birth/death as part of the title of each article (so to avoid cases where people have the same name, but are children/cousins/etc of others with that name).  However, some of this information changes.  For instance, I didn't know a date of death and now I do, or I had it wrong originally, or it turns out someone is still alive I didn't know about.  All of these cases leave me with bad article titles.

So, I can go ahead and move the file to a new page with the correct info, orphan that page, provide a link for the new page if desired, and otherwise ignore that page.  But then, it clutters up the wiki and serves no useful purpose.

Anyway to consider implementing **rename/move/delete** ?  I certainly lack the skills to appreciate what this would entail, but feel free to comment if it appears impossible, and then I'll go back to the aforementioned workaround.  I would prefer simple rename, however.

Thanks again to [Joey](http://kitenet.net/~joey) for putting ikiwiki together.  I love the program.

The MediaWiki moving/renaming mechanism is pretty nice.  It's easy to get a list of pages that point to the current page.  When renaming a page it sticks a forwarding page in the original place.  The larger the size of the wiki the more important organization tools become.

I see the need for:

* a new type of file to represent a forwarding page
* a rename tool that can
* * move the existing page to the new name
* * optionally drop a forwarding page
* * optionally rewrite incoming links to the new location

(hrm, side note, does markdown not support nested bulleted lists?)
