[[!tag patch]]

[[plugins/map]] (and I) could benefit from a bonus parameter:

	else="Display this if no page matches the PageSpec"

This was quite simple, so I implemented this (branch "map" in my
ikiwiki repo, see my user page for the up-to-date URL). Not patched the
documentation yet, I'm waiting for feedback first, but I'll do it for sure. -- [[intrigeri]]
