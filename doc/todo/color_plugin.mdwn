Recently I've wanted to colour some piece of text on my Ikiwiki page.
It seems that Markdown can do it only using HTML tags, so I used
`<span class="color">foo bar baz</span>`.

However, in my opinion mixing Markdown syntax and HTML tags is rather ugly,
so maybe we should create a new color plugin to add more color to Ikiwiki ;)
I know that another Wikis have similar plugin, for example
[WikiDot](http://www.wikidot.com/).

I've noticed that htmlscrubber plugin strips `style` attribute, because of
security, so probably we need to use `class` attribute of HTML. But then
we have to customize our `local.css` file to add all color we want to use.
It's not as easy in usage like color name or definition as plugin argument,
but I don't have a better idea right now.

What do you think about it? --[[Paweł|ptecza]]
