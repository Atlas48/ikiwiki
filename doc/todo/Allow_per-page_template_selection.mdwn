It'd be nice to be able to specify an altenate template file to be
used for some pages. For example, I'd like most of my pages to use
page.tmpl but I want my front page to be formatted in some unique way,
so I'd like it to use a separate front.tmp template instead.

I'm not sure what syntax to use for this, (\[[template]] seems to be
taken for another purpose already). Perhaps something like
\[[page-template front]] ?).
