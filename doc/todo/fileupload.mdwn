Support for uploading files is useful for many circumstances:

* Uploading images.
* Uploading local.css files (admin only).
* Uploading mp3s for podcasts.
* Etc.

ikiwiki should have an easy to use interface for this, but the real meat of
the work is in securing it. Several classes of controls seem appropriate:

* Limits to size of files that can be uploaded. Prevent someone spamming
  the wiki with CD isos..
* Limits to the type of files that can be uploaded. To prevent uploads of
  virii, css, raw html etc, and avoid file types that are not safe.
  Should default to excluding all files types, or at least all
  except a very limited set, and should be able to open it up to more
  types.

  Would checking for file extensions (.gif, .jpg) etc be enough? Some
  browsers are probably too smart for their own good and may ignore the
  extension / mime info and process as the actual detected file type. It
  may be necessary to use `file` to determine a file's true type.
* Limits to who can upload what type of files.
* Limits to what files can be uploaded where.

It seems that for max flexability, rules should be configurable by the admin
to combine these limits in different ways. If we again extend the pagespec
for this, as was done for [[conditional_text_based_on_ikiwiki_features]],
the rules might look something like this:

	( maxsize(30kb) and type(webimage) ) or
	( user(joey) and maxsize(1mb) and (type(webimage) or *.mp3) ) or
	( user(joey) and maxsize(200mb) and (*.mov or *.avi) and videos/*)
