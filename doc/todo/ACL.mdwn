How about adding ACL? So that you can control which users are allowed
to read, write certain pages. The moinmoin wiki has that, and it is
something, that I think is very valuable.

I am considering giving this a try, implementing it as a module.
Here is how I see it:

  * a new preprocessor directive allows to define ACL entries providing permissions
    for a given (user, page, operation), as in:

    <pre>
    \[[acl user=joe page=*.png allow=upload]]
    \[[acl user=bob page=/blog/bob/* allow=*]]
    \[[acl user=* page=/blog/bob/* deny=*]]
    \[[acl user=http://jeremie.koenig.myopenid.com/ page=/todo/* deny=create
           reason="spends his time writing todo items instead of source code"]]
    </pre>

    Each would expand to a description of the resulting rule.

  * a configurable page of the wiki would be used as an ACL list.
    Possibly could refer to other ACL pages, as in:

    <pre>
    \[[acl user=* page=/subsite/* acl=/subsite/acl.mdwn]]
    </pre>
