Some inconsistences around the toplevel [[index]] page:

* [[ikiwiki]] is a separate page; links to [[ikiwiki]] should better go to
  the [[index]] though.
* The toplevel [[ikiwiki/Discussion]] page has some weird parentlinks
  behavior. This could be special cased around with the following patch.
  However, I'm unsure if I like the idea of more special cases around this.
  It would be better to find a way to make the toplevel index page not be a
  special case at all.
