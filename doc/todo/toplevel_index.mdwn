Some inconsistences around the toplevel [[index]] page:

* The page's title is "index"; the linkpath looks like "ikiwiki / index".
  IMHO it would be nicer if the title were "ikiwiki" and the linkpath was
  just "ikiwiki" (for this wiki).
* [[ikiwiki]] is a separate page; links to [[ikiwiki]] should better go to
  the [[index]] though.
