After using it for a while, my feeling is that hyperestradier, as used in
the [[plugins/search]] plugin, is not robust enough for ikiwiki. It doesn't
upgrade well, and it has a habit of sig-11 on certian input from time to
time.

So some other engine should be found and used instead. Enrico had one that
he was using for debtags stuff that looked pretty good.
