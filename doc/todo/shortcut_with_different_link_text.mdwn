I'd like the ability to use a shortcut, but declare an explicit link text rather than using the link text defined on [[/shortcuts]].  For example, if I create a shortcut "xcbgit" pointing to files in an XCB gitweb repository, I don't always want to use the path to the file as the link text; I would like to src/xcb.xsd, but use the link text "XML Schema for the X Window System protocol".
