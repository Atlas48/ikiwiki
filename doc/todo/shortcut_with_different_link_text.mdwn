I'd like the ability to use a shortcut, but declare an explicit link text
rather than using the link text defined on [[/shortcuts]].  For example, if I
create a shortcut `protogit` pointing to files in the xcb/proto.git gitweb
repository, I don't always want to use the path to the file as the link text;
I would like to src/xcb.xsd, but use the link text "XML Schema for the X
Window System protocol".  --[[JoshTriplett]]
