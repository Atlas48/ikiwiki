Would it make sense to automatically delete a page if it's edited and
cleared to be entirely empty (or only have whitespace)? Discuss.

 I'd say so; yes. A method of deleting pages via the web would be great; I can't think of a use of keeping blank pages around. What about vandalism -- if someone blanks a page and deletes it and someone else wishes to restore it; or is undoing edits via the web a bigger issue? -- [[JonDowland]]
