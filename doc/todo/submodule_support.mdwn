I would love to be able to publish my theme in my personnal wiki. The theme is in a separate git repository, and i feel it would be pretty awesome if it was rendered within my main ikiwiki site. I have tried the following:

    git submodule add /usr/share/ikiwiki/themes/night_city/
    git commit -m"add the theme to my site" ; git push

But this made really weird things on the other side. The files from the theme end up flat in the parent directory. Now I have reverted the above change and ikiwiki *still* generates those files. Not sure what is going on. Other people had experience with this? Or other suggestions on how to publish repositories within my site? -- [[anarcat]]
