* Render each changed page only once. Currently pages are rendered up to 4
  times in worst case (8 times if there's an rss feed).

  The issue is that rendering a page is used to gather info like the links
  on the page that can effect rendering other pages. So it needs a
  multi-pass system. But rendering the whole page in each pass is rather
  obscene.

* Don't render blog archive pages unless a page is added/removed. Just
  changing a page doesn't affect the archives as they show only the title.

* Look at splitting up CGI.pm. But note that too much splitting can slow
  perl down.
