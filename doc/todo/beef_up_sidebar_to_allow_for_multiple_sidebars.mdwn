Maybe sidebar could be beefed up to take the name of a sidebar, such that I could use multiple sidebars in the same wiki. For instance, the default name would be 'sidebar', meaning the plugin looks for `sidebar.pm` and fills in the `sidebar` slot, but I might also want a footer in `footer.pm`, filling the template's `footer` slot.

Maybe a new `include` plugin would be better.
