Being case insensative is handy, but it does make the [[BackLinks]] and
[[blog]] links a bit ugly compared to other links. It should be possible to
support pagenames that have uppercase, while still allowing them to be
linked to using any case.

Also, newly created pagenames that include upper case characters should
perhaps not automatically be converted to lower case then.

Also, it's currently possible to check in a filename with uppercase and
ikiwiki will render it that way, but fail to edit it online and probably in
other ways.
