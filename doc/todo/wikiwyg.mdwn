[Wikiwyg](http://www.wikiwyg.net/)
is a WYSIWYG editor written in javascript for wikis. It allows editing in a
gui or in wikitext and converts edits back to wiki format to be saved to
the wiki.

It would be awesome to use this in ikiwiki, but to take full advantage of
it with ikiwiki, it would need to know about MarkDown.
