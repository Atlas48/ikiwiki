The [[ikiwiki/directive/inline]] directive allows the creation of new pages.
It would be nice if it was possible to specify default text for the new post.
For example:

    \[[!inline pages="blog/* and !*/Discussion" postform="yes" newposttemplate="blogtemplate.mdwn"]]

This would allow you to create a new blog post.  When you hit the 'Edit' button, the system presents
you with an edit form as normal, but rather than being empty, it has the text from `blogtemplate.mdwn`.
