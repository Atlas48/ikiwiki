Stuff the [[plugins/attachment]] plugin is currently missing, that might be
nice to add:

* Add a progress bar for attachment uploads (needs AJAX stuff..)
* Maybe optimise the "Insert Links" button with javascript, so, if
  javascript is available, the link is inserted at the current cursor
  position in the page edit form, without actually reposting the form.
  (Falling back to the current reposting of the form if javascript is not
  available of course.)
* An option to not `rcs_add` new attachments, but just write them to the
  srcdir. This would allow the admin to review them, and manually
  add/delete them before they bloat history.
