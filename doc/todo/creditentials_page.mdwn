pushing [[this|todo/httpauth feature parity with passwordauth]] further: would it make sense for users to have a `$USER/creditentials` page that is by default locked to the user and admins, where the user can state one or more of the below?

* OpenID
* ssh public key (would require an additional mechanism for writing this to a `authorized_keys` file with appropriate environment variables or prefix that makes sure the commit is checked against the right user and that the user names agree)
* gpg public key (once there is a mechanism that relies on gpg for authentication))
* https certificate hash (don't know details; afair the creation of such certificates is typically initiated server-side)
* password hash (this is generally considered a valuable secret; is this still true with good hashes and proper salting?)

such a page could have a form as described in [[todo/structured page data]] and could even serve as a way of managing users. --[[chrysn]]
