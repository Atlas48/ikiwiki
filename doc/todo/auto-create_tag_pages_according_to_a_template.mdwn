It would be great if I could tell ikiwiki to automatically instantiate pages for each tag, according to a template, especially when `$tagbase` is set.

Tags are mainly specific to the object to which they’re stuck. However, I often use them the other way around, too: as concepts. And sometimes I’d like to see all pages related to a given concept (“tagged with a given tag”). The only way to do this with ikiwiki is to instantiate a page for each tag and slap a map on it. This is quite tedious and I’d really love to see Ikiwiki do so by default for all tags.

I would love to see this as well. -- dato
