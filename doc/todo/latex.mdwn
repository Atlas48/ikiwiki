How about a plugin adding a
[[preprocessor_directive|preprocessordirective]] to render some given LaTeX
and include it in the page?  This could either render the LaTeX as a PNG via
[[debpkg dvipng]] and include the resulting image in the page, or perhaps
render via [HeVeA](http://pauillac.inria.fr/~maranget/hevea/index.html) or
similar. Useful for mathematics, as well as for stuff like the LaTeX version
of the ikiwiki [[/logo]].

ikiwiki could also support LaTeX as a document type, again rendering to HTML.

Conversely, how about adding a plugin to support exporting to LaTeX?

>>> Have a look at [pandoc](http://code.google.com/p/pandoc/).  It can make PDFs via pdflatex. --[[roktas]]

[here](http://ng.l4x.org/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=ikiwiki.git/.git;a=blob;f=IkiWiki/Plugin/latex.pm) is a first stab at
a latex plugin. Examples [here](http://ng.l4x.org/latex/). Currently without image support for hevea. And the latex2html
output has the wrong charset and no command line switch to change that. Dreamland.
