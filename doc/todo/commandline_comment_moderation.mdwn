So I have enabled the [[moderatedcomments]] plugin on my wiki. and good thing that! around 1000 spammy comments showed up in the last 3 months! Awful!

It's pretty hard to figure out the ham and the spam in there. One thing I was hoping was to use the power of the commandline to filter through all that stuff. Now, it seems there's only a "ikiwiki-comment" tool now, and nothing to examine the moderated comments.

It seems to me it would be great to have some tool to filter through that...


So it turns out it was over 3000 comments. The vast majority of those (every one but 42 comments) were from the IP `46.161.41.34` which i recommend null-routing everywhere. I used the following shell magic to figure that out:

<pre>
# locate the transient directory
cd $source/.ikiwiki/transient
# count the number of comments
find . -name '*._comment_pending' | wc
# number of comments per IP
find . -name '*._comment_pending' | xargs grep -h ip= | sort | uniq -c | sort -n
# generate a banlist for insertion in `banusers`, assuming all the pending comments are spam
find . -name '*._comment_pending' | xargs grep -h ip= | sort -u| sed 's/ ip="//;s/"//;s/^/- ip(/;s/$/)/'
# remove comments from a bad guy
find . -name '*._comment_pending' | xargs grep -l 'ip="46.161.41.34"'| xargs rm
# flush all pending comments
find . -name '*._comment_pending' -delete
</pre>

The remaining 42 comments I reviewed throught the web interface, then flushed using the above command. My final addition to the banlist is:

<pre>
- ip(159.224.160.225)
- ip(176.10.104.227)
- ip(176.10.104.234)
- ip(188.143.233.211)
- ip(193.201.227.41)
- ip(195.154.181.152)
- ip(213.238.175.29)
- ip(31.184.238.11)
- ip(37.57.231.112)
- ip(37.57.231.204)
- ip(46.161.41.34)
- ip(46.161.41.199)
- ip(95.130.13.111)
- ip(95.181.178.142)
</pre>
