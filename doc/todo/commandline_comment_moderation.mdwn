So I have enabled the [[moderatedcomments]] plugin on my wiki. and good thing that! around 1000 spammy comments showed up in the last 3 months! Awful!

It's pretty hard to figure out the ham and the spam in there. One thing I was hoping was to use the power of the commandline to filter through all that stuff. Now, it seems there's only a "ikiwiki-comment" tool now, and nothing to examine the moderated comments.

It seems to me it would be great to have some tool to filter through that... --[[anarcat]]
