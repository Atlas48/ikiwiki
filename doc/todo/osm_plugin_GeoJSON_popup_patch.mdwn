[[!tag patch]]

When using the GeoJSON output of the OSM plugin (osm_format: GeoJSON), the name and description in the popups are missing, this patch fixes the issue.

>> This is especially confusing because this is actually about JSON, not KML. Disregarding that, here's the [geojson homepage](http://geojson.org/) which has a link to the spec. The spec doesn't seem to specify `description`, `desc` or `name` anywhere. --[[anarcat]]
