It should be possible to configure ikiwiki online, in the wiki admin's
preferences form. Rather than the current situation where most settings are
in ikiwiki.setup, and one or two (like locked pages and upload limits) in
the admin preferences.

In theory, every setting could be configured there. In practice, some
settings, like `srcdir` and `destdir` are ones you want to keep far away
from editing via the web.

One way to do it would be for the ikiwiki.setup to allow delegating
specific settings to the admin prefs.. lets say by setting them to undef,
while values that the admin prefs can't set would be set as usual:

	rss => undef,
	atom => undef,
	discussion => undef,
	syslog => undef,
	srcdir => "/srv/www",
	plugins => undef,

Currently admin prefs are per-admin, and are stored in the userdb.
That seems like a bad choice in the context of this idea. Instead, admin
prefs should be shared amoung all admins, and the ideal storage would be
another ikiwiki setup file, which could be loaded in, and written back out.

If `ikiwiki-makerepo` were extended a little bit to generate the stub setup
file that's enough to get `ikiwiki.cgi` working, and that sets values for
all the dangerous options, leaving only safe ones 'undef', then users could
set up ikiwiki using it, and configure the rest with the web interface,
without ever needing to edit a setup file.

Implementing this probably means, for every setup option, adding a short
description, that links to a long description on a basewiki page, and a type
specifier so that it can be represented well in the web interface. Also
some way to group options into sections. --[[Joey]]
