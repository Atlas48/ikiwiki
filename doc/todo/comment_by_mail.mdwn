I would like to allow comments on ikiwiki pages without CGI.
I have in mind something like

  * Use a pagetemplate hook  (based on a quick glance at tschwinge's copyright.pm)
    in a plugin
  * add a mailto: url to each page matching some pagespec
  * this mailto url goes to an address identifying the page  (something like
    user-iki-FE653b@host.fqdn.tld).  
  * on the mail receiving end, these messages are either deleted, or ran through
    a filter to be turned into blog posts.
  * the same plugin can check for comments on a particular page next time the wiki 
    is generated, and add a link.

Any comments? Write them here or send them to [[DavidBremner]]

* work in progress can be 
  - [cloned](http://pivot.cs.unb.ca/git/ikiperl.git), or browsed 
  - [browsed](http://pivot.cs.unb.ca/git/?p=ikipostal.git;a=summary)
