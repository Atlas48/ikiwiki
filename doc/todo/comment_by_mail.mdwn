I would like to allow comments on ikiwiki pages without CGI.
I have in mind something like

  * Use a pagetemplate hook  
    in a plugin (DONE)
  * add a mailto: url to each page matching some pagespec
    (currently every page gets a comment footer)
  * this mailto url goes to an address identifying the page  (something like
    user-iki-FE653b@host.fqdn.tld).  (DONE) 
  * on the mail receiving end, these messages are either deleted, or ran through
    a filter to be turned into blog posts.

    - I'm thinking about how the filter should work. Within a 
    mail client, or as a batch tool to scan a mailbox? How to    interact with version control, if at all?

  * the same plugin can check for comments on a particular page next time the wiki 
    is generated, and add a link. (more or less done)
  * work in progress can be 

   - [cloned](http://pivot.cs.unb.ca/git/ikiperl.git), or 
   - [browsed](http://pivot.cs.unb.ca/git/?p=ikipostal.git;a=summary)
  

Any comments? Write them here or send them to [[DavidBremner]]
