At the moment the text area in the edit form has a fixed size of 20 rows.

On longer pages its not very comfortable to edit pages with such a small box. The whole screen size should be used instead([example](http://img3.imagebanana.com/img/bl10u9mb/editingtodo_1241804460828.png)).

> The whole screen width is used, via the following
> from style.css:
>
>	{
>	 width: 100%;
>	}
>
> Perhaps you have replaced it with a modified style sheet that does not
> include that? --[[Joey]] [[!tag done]]
