* Eventually, might want page deletion.
* Eventually, might want file upload.
* Page move? Link corrections?

>(I left this comment in discussion, but it might be better here on the main page)  This is a function I would really like.  I am dealing with a situation, in creating a link for my family history, for instance to "Peter Richard MacLea (1888-c.1946)" and fleshing out an article with pictures and so on.  Then, I later find out that Peter died in 1948.  So, I want to move that page to "Peter Richard MacLea (1888-1948)".  There doesn't seem to be an easy way to do this.  The main problem being that I can easily create a second page with that data, but what happens to the old one?  Does it remain?  I would like to see at least a rename or page move function.... *[Kyle](http://kitenet.net/~kyle/family/wiki/)=*
