I was suprised that, when using the map directive, a pagespec of "*"
listed all the translated pages as well as regular pages. That can 
make a big difference to an existing wiki when po is turned on,
and seems generally not wanted.
(OTOH, you do want to match translated pages by
default when locking pages.) --[[Joey]]
