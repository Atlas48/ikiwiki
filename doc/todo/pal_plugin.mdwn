A plugin to generate calendars using [pal](http://palcal.sourceforge.net/).

Main issues:

* pal's html output is not well formed
* make sure it's secure
* calendaers change with time, so ikiwiki would need to be run from cron
  daily to update them, and the plugin would need to somehow mark the page
  as needing a rebuild after time had passed
