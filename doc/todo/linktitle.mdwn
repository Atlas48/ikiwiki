Pages could have a `linktitle` (perhaps via [[plugins/meta]]), and
[[wikilinks|wikilink]] could use that title by default when linking to the
page.  That would allow pages to have a simple, easily linkable name (without
spaces, for instance), but use the proper title for links.  For example,
[[PreprocessorDirective]] could use the `linktitle` "preprocessor directive",
and pages for [[users]] could have `linktitle`s that put spaces in their
names.

Ideally, perhaps two versions of the title could exist, one for general use,
and an optional one for if the case in the actual link starts with an
uppercase letter.  That would allow [[preprocessordirective]] to use the link
text "preprocessor directive", but [[PreprocessorDirective]] to use the link
text "Preprocessor Directive", for use at the beginnings of sentences.  If the
second version did not exist, the first version would apply to both cases.
However, that also seems like potential overkill, and less important than the
basic functionality of `linktitle`.
