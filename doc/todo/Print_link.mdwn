I think that Print link to open popup window with printable
HTML version of page is very useful thing, so I would like
to have it in my ikiwiki :)

Probably it's better to generate a page on the fly as a CGI
(just the same like for RecentChanges page) when a user
really needs it, instead to build static printable version
for all ikiwiki pages. --Pawel
