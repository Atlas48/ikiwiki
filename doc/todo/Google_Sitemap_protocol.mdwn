It would be useful if ikiwiki was able to create [google sitemap][1] files to allow easy indexing.

What I don't get is exactly how ikiwiki, as a static wiki that's quite
deeply hyperlinked, benefits from a sitemap. The orphans plugin can
produce a map of pages that other pages do not link to, if you're worried
about having such pages not found by web spiders.
