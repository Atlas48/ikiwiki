In the [MoinMoin wiki][], there is this neat little hack called
[Admonitions][] that basically create a `<div>` block with a specific
style out of a certain section of the text.

I couldn't find a way to do this easily in Ikiwiki. On the one hand,
there is no easy way to create div blocks with arbitrary styles (which
is basically what MoinMoin admonitions are). On the other hand, there
are no neat little logos in stylesheets like there are in Moinmoin
either.

It would be great to see this implemented in Ikiwiki. Now, I know I
can make a `<div>` myself, but I am not sure we should encourage users
to inject arbitrary HTML in ikiwiki pages. And even then, we should
add adminition CSS classes to make that easier to use.

Ideally, Ikiwiki would support Pandoc or Github-style fenced blocks
and could abuse those to allow arbitrary styles (and markup!) to kick
in. The [[ikiwiki/directive/format]] directive could also be used, I
guess, but I dislike how it requires all those brackets and quotes and
bangs and all...
