I think I would like mail notifications. Though it kinda comes out of this general fear of vandalisation really.

So if you someone turned my wiki into a porn site, I would like to rectify it ASAP. So I would like:

1. Mail notifications of edits not made by me (or established contributors)
2. If there is something fishy, the steps I would need to revert the changes

Mail notifications are probably not required. For example I get lots of comments on my blog, but I don't get mailed about them. They go through the (proprietary) [Akismet](http://akismet.com/) filter.
