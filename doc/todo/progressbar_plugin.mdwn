I would like to add next plugin to Ikiwiki. It's `progressbar` or simply `progress`.
I'm not sure what plugin name better is, probably that shorter ;) I know that
[DokuWiki](http://wiki.splitbrain.org/plugin:progressbar) has similar plugin,
so I think it can be useful also for Ikiwiki users.

Here is proposition of the plugin syntax:

    \[[!progress done=50]]

Of course, `done` argument is integer from 0 to 100. 

A here is its HTML result:

    <div class="progress">
      <div class="progress-done" style="width: 50%">50%</div>
    </div>

Note: I was trying with `<span>` tags too, but that tag is inline, so I can't
set `width` property for it.

Default CSS styles for the plugin can be like below:

    div.progress {
            border: 1px solid #ddd;
            /* border: 2px solid #ddd; */
            width: 200px;
            background: #fff;
            padding: 2px;
            /* padding: 0px; */
            border: 2px solid #aaa;
            background: #eee;
    }
    div.progress-done {
            height: 14px;
            background: #ff6600;
            font-size: 12px;
            text-align: center;
            vertical-align: middle;
    }

You can use alternative, commented CSS code for `div.progress` if you dislike
padding around done strip.

Any comments? --[[PaweÅ‚|ptecza]]

    \[[!progress totalpages="bugs/* and backlink(milestoneB)" donepages="bugs/* and backlink(milestoneB) and !link(bugs/done)"]]
