Ok, I have to admit, I have no idea if this is an April fool's joke or not.  
Congratulations for demonstrating that April fools jokes can still be subtle

I'm torn about this idea, if it's actually serious.  I'm very comfortable programming in Perl, and have written quite a few modules for IkiWiki, and it would be a huge pain to have to start from scratch all over again.
On the other hand, this could be a motivation for me to learn Haskell.  My only encounter with Haskell has been a brief time when I was using the Xmonad window manager, but it looks like an interesting language. Functional programming is cool.
