After realizing (thanks to
[[Allow_TITLE_to_include_part_of_the_path_in_addition_to_the_basename]])
that I needed some kind of "parentlinks on steroids", I wrote a new
plugin, called pedigree.

This plugin provides a bunch of loops that one can use in his/her
`HTML::Template`'s to iterate over all or a subset of a page's
parents. Inside these loops, half a dozen variables are made
available, in addition to `PAGE` and `URL` that are already provided
by parentlinks.

Amongst many possibilities, one can e.g. simply use this plugin to
give every parent link a different `class=` attribute, depending
either on its depth in the path leading to the current page, or on its
distance to it.

The code and documentation (including simple and complex usage
examples) are in the 'pedigree' Git branch in this repo:

	git://repo.or.cz/ikiwiki/intrigeri.git

Seems there is also a [gitweb](http://repo.or.cz/w/ikiwiki/intrigeri.git).

Any opinions on the idea/design/implementation?

What needs to be changed so that it's possible to include it in
mainline ikiwiki?

(I'll try never to rebase this branch, but writing this plugin has
been a pretext for me to start learning Git, so...)

To finish with, it seems no plugin bundled with ikiwiki uses the current parentlinks implementation, so one could event think of moving it from the core to this plugin (which should then be enabled by default, since the default templates do use parentlinks ;).
