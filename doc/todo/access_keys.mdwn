Access keys (i.e., keyboard shortcuts) can be defined for common
features.  Something like the following:

* 1 - Homepage
* 2 - Search box
* E - Edit
* R - RecentChanges
* H - History
* P - Preferences
* D - Discussion
* S - Save the current page (when editing)
* C - Cancel the current edit
* V - Preview the current page

Then, for example, in Firefox one could press Alt+Shift+E to edit the
page.

For links, this is implemented as:

    <a href="recentchanges/" accesskey="r">RecentChanges</a>

and for forms buttons:

    <input type="submit" value="Submit" accesskey="s"/>

There were also a few thoughts about access keys on the
[[main_discussion_page|index/discussion]]. Now moved to here:

The main criticism there it
seems is that some browsers implement access keys in a way (via the Alt
key) that allows them to override built-in keyboard shortcuts.  I
believe this is not a problem any longer in Firefox (which uses the
Shift+Alt prefix) but I suppose it could still be a problem in other
browsers.

Another criticism is that most browsers do not display the access keys
that are defined.  The [article][] cited on the main discussion page
suggests underlining the relevant mnemonic.  I think it would be
sufficient to just list them in the basewiki documentation somewhere.

It's an unfortunate situation&mdash;I'd like an alternative to the
rodent but there are quite a few downsides to using access keys.
Tabbing isn't quite the same as a nice shortcut key.  There's always
