Please don't shoot me for asking:

Could we have an ikiwiki mailing list?

Here's an example use case:
I want to discuss building a feature. Such discussion could happen on the wiki, but I would prefer to---at the least---be able to email ikiwiki developers and ask them to participate in this particular discussion.

Does this sound okay?
