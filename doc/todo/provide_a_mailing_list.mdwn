I am aware that you (Joey) [[made_a_choice_against_a_mailing_list|contact]],
but I would like to see you reconsider.

The wiki works well for bugs and
collaborating on the software, but not for simple user support issues. For
instance, I spent the last three days waiting for any form of reply to my
question on IRC (none so far):

    09 15:49 < madduck> any ideas how to implement a two-level menu
    09 15:40 < madduck> like http://www.abacons.ch/leistungen/treuhand.html ?
    09 15:50 < madduck> the top bar are the main sections
    09 15:50 < madduck> and then i might need subsections (further down) under each
    09 15:50 < madduck> i'd like to do this without hardcoding sections in the template
    09 15:50 < madduck> but at least the main sections are to appear on all pages
    09 15:50 < madduck> so the template needs a slot, i just wonder how best to fill it
    09 15:51 < madduck> i can only ever use one navbar it seems
    09 15:51 < madduck> and i already need the sidebar for something else

I would not know where to take this question on the wiki itself.

A mailing list is made for these kind of questions, and as we pick up even
more users, the number of such requests will also increase. --[[madduck]]
