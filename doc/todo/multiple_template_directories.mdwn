It would be nice to be able to override a single template without keeping a 
private copy of the entire template directory. 

a setup option like

   templatedirs => [ "my/dir", "/usr/share/ikiwiki/templates" ] 

ought to do the trick.

I have a use case for this, a site composed of blogs and wikis, templates divided in three categoriesâ€¯: common, blog and wiki. The only solution I found is maintaining hard links, being able to have multiple template dirs would obviously be better. -- Changaco
