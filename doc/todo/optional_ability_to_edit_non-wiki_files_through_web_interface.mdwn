I actually appreciate the feature you added which prohibits editing arbitrary
files in the repository through the web interface, just by editing the URL. :)
However, for some ikiwikis I manage, I trust all the users with accounts, and
I'd thus like to grant them access to edit certain non-wiki files, such as the
CSS.  Given the new framework for access control plugins, how about a plugin
to set the policy for editing non-wiki files?  Configured correctly, this
could even allow policies like "you have to have an account to edit non-wiki
files".

I'd prefer to handle this with a file upload feature, since the security
issues it will need to deal with are the same, and the set of non-wiki
files that can be edited in a text editor is a lot smaller than the set of
files a user might want to upload. --[[Joey]]
