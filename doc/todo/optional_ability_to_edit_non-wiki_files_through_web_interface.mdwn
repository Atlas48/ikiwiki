I actually appreciate the feature you added which prohibits editing arbitrary
files in the repository through the web interface, just by editing the URL. :)
However, for some ikiwikis I manage, I trust all the users with accounts, and
I'd thus like to grant them access to edit certain non-wiki files, such as the
CSS.  Given the new framework for access control plugins, how about a plugin
to set the policy for editing non-wiki files?  Configured correctly, this
could even allow policies like "you have to have an account to edit non-wiki
files".
