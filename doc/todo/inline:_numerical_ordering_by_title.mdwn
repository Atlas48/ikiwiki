Could you please add numerical ordering by title to [[inline|plugins/inline]]
plugin? Now I can do only alphabetical order by title, but sometime it's not enough.

BTW, it seems that ordering by title is rather ordering by filename of page.
For me "title" means title of page I can set using `title` parameter
of [[meta|plugins/meta]] plugin :)

Why do I need that feature? I've just been migrating an info site of our university
[mail system](http://poczta.uw.edu.pl/) to Ikiwiki from very static, console handling
Makefile+[WML](http://thewml.org/)+XML+XSL=HTML solution. I have many news files
(`1.mdwn`, `2.mdwn`, etc.) and unfortunately I did very stupid thing. I've commited
all of them in the same revision of our Subversion repo...

Now I have a problem with sorting these files using inline plugin. I can't do
sorting by age, because both old and young news files have the same age. I can't
sort by title too. For example, when I sort them by title, then `9.mdwn` page is
between `90.mdwn` and `89.mdwn` pages... It sucks, of course. Sorting by mtime
also is not a solution for me, because it means that I can't touch/fix old news
anymore.

Do you have any idea how to workaround that issue? --[[Paweł|ptecza]]

Below is my simple patch. Feel free to use it or comment!

I have also 2 considerations for inline sorting:

1. Maybe changing name of `sort` parameter to `sortby` or `sortkey` will
   be good idea?
1. Maybe you should use `title` sort key for title from meta plugin and `name`, 
   `filename`, `page` or `pagename` for page names? In the future you can also
   sort by meta author, license or another key.
