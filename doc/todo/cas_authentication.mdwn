ikiwiki should support [Central Authentication Service](http://www.ja-sig.org/products/cas/) authentication in order to use this <acronym title='Single Sign On'>SSO</acronym> mechanism very popular in universities web services.

I have already written a first draft plugin supporting that authentication mechanism.

What is the best way to submit it to you ?
