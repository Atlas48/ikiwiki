ikiwiki should support utf-8 pages, both input and output

Currently ikiwiki is belived to be utf-8 clean itself; it tells perl to use
binmode when reading possibly binary files (such as images) and it uses
utf-8 compatable regexps etc.

utf-8 IO is not enabled by default though. While you can probably embed
utf-8 in pages anyway, ikiwiki will not treat it right in the cases where
it deals with things on a per-character basis (mostly when escaping and
de-escaping special characters in filenames).

To enable utf-8, edit ikiwiki and add -CSD to the perl hashbang line.
(This should probably be configurable via a --utf8 or better --encoding=
switch.)

The following problems have been observed when running ikiwiki this way:

* If invalid utf-8 creeps into a file, ikiwiki will crash rendering it as
  follows:

	Malformed UTF-8 character (unexpected continuation byte 0x97, with no preceding start byte) in substitution iterator at /usr/bin/markdown line 1317.
	Malformed UTF-8 character (fatal) at /usr/bin/markdown line 1317.

  In this example, a literal 0x97 character had gotten into a markdown
  file.
