It should be possible to use anonymous git push to post comments
(created, say, by a ikiwiki-comment program). Currently, that is not
allowed, because users cannot edit, or create internal page files.
But, comments in allowed locations are an exception to that rule, and 
that exception should be communicated somehow to `IkiWiki::Receive`.
