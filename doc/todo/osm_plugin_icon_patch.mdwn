[[!tag patch]]

Currently, the documented icon parameter to the waypoint directive is not used. This patch fixes that, and fixes some related problems in the KML output. 

> That patch looks pretty awesome, thanks for your work on it. I don't have time to test it now, but if it works, I am all for its inclusion. It does seem that it overlaps with [[bugs/osm_plugin_error_TypeError:_mapProjection_is_null]] however, maybe you'd want to separate the patches for clarity... --[[anarcat]]
