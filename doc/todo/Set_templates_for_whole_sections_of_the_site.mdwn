At the moment, IkiWiki allows you to set the template for individual pages using the [[plugins/pagetemplate]] directive/plugin, but not for whole sections of the wiki.

I've written a new plugin, sectiontemplate, available in the `page_tmpl` branch of my git repository that allows setting the template by pagespec in the config file.
