I would like to put two RFEs into the pool. 

1. Believe Apache auth.  I would like ikiwiki to get the current user from the apache auth.  It could optionally save user preferences based upon those names.  Like email address and such.

2. A way of uploading arbitrary files and referencing them within ikiwiki.  I know ikiwiki can already deal with arbitrary files within its RCS store, but it would be nice to be able to upload files through the web.

I'm willing to help out on creating these features, but I don't really know perl so it might take me some time.  Id be willing to buy someone a beer if they would get to these before me.  :-D
