Now that ikiwiki supports using page/index.html rather than page.html, how about some mechanism to automatically generate a .htaccess file with "Redirect permanent" lines for each such page?

	RewriteCond $1 !^/~
	RewriteCond $1 !^/doc/
	RewriteCond $1 !^/cgi-bin/
	RewriteRule (.+).html $1/ [R]
	#RewriteRule /~family/(.+).html /~family/$1/ [R]
