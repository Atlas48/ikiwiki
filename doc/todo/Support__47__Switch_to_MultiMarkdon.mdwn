Supporting or switching to MultiMarkdown would take care of a few of the outstanding feature requests. Quoting from the MultiMarkdown site:

>MultiMarkdown is a modification of John Gruber's original Markdown.pl file. It uses the same basic syntax, with several additions:

>   1.	I have added a basic metadata feature, to allow the inclusion of
>	metadata within a document that can be used in different ways based
>	on the output format.

>   2.	I have allowed the automatic use of cross-references within a Markdown
>	document.  For instance, you can easily jump to
>	[the Introduction][Introduction].

>   3.	I have incorporated John's proposed syntax for footnotes. Since he
>	has not determined the output format, I created my own.  Mainly, I 
>	wanted to be able to add footnotes to the LaTeX output; I was less 
>	concerned with the XHTML formatting.

>   4.	Most importantly, however, I have changed the way that the processed 
>	output is created, so that it is quite simple to export Markdown syntax
>	to a variety of outputs.  By setting the `Format` metadata to `complete`,
>	you generate a well-formed XHTML page.  You can then use XSLT to convert
>	to virtually any format you like.

MultiMarkdown would solve the BibTex request and the multiple output formats would make the print_link request an easy fix. MultiMarkdown is actively developed and can be found at:
