* Need to get post commit hook working (or an example of how to use it.)
* rcs_notify is not implemented
* Is the code sufficiently robust? It just warns when mercurial fails.
* When rcs_commit is called with a $user that is an openid, it will be
  passed through to mercurial -u. Will mercurual choke on this?
