* Need to get post commit hook working (or an example of how to use it.)
* rcs_notify is not implemented
* Is the code sufficiently robust? It just warns when mercurial fails.
* When rcs_commit is called with a $user that is an openid, it will be
  passed through to mercurial -u. Will mercurial choke on this?
* The rcs_commit implementation seems not to notice if the file has been
  changed since a web edit started. Unlike all the other frontends, which
  use the rcstoken to detect if the web commit started editing an earlier
  version of the file, and if so, merge the two sets of changes together.
  It seems that with the current mercurial commit code, it will always
  blindly overwrite the current file with the web edited version, losing
  any other changes.
