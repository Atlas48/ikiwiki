I see that ikiwiki has already some [[bugs]] stored on the wiki, but adding
better support for bug tracking would really make it a good project
management system for small projects. Storing the sourcecode, wiki, developer
blog and the issue tracker information under a same revision control
system really makes sense. At the moment the only part missing from ikiwiki 
is the bug tracker plugin.

The support would not need to be anything fancy, assignment of bug numbers
is perhaps the biggest thing missing when compared to a plain wiki page.
Integration with the revision control system a la [scmbug](http://www.mkgnu.net/?q=scmbug) 
would really neat though, so that bug tracker commands like (closes: #nnn) could 
be embedded to the source code repository commit messages.
