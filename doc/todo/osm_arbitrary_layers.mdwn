I got tired of hacking at the osm.pm every time I wanted to change the layers, so I made it so the layers can be changed in the .setup file. In my master branch, there are now two new configuration settings: `osm_layers` and `osm_layers_order` which replace the hackish `osm_mapurl`. The variables are a hash and an array that allow the operator to define the list of URLs to be loaded as layers and also to change the order of layers. -- [[users/anarcat]]
