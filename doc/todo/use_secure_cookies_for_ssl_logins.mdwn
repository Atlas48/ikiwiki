[[!tag patch]]

At the moment `sslcookie => 0` never creates secure cookies, so if you log in
with SSL, your browser will send the session cookie even over plain HTTP.
Meanwhile `sslcookie => 1` always creates secure cookies, so you can't
usefully log in over plain http.

This branch adds `sslcookie => 0, sslcookie_auto => 1` as an option; this
uses the `HTTPS` environment variable, so if you log in over SSL you'll
get a secure session cookie, but if you log in over HTTP, you won't.
(The syntax for the setup file is pretty rubbish - any other suggestions?)
