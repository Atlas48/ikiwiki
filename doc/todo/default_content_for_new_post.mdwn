Along the same lines as having a [[default_name_for_new_post]]s, an option
to include default content in a new [[plugins/inline]] post would help with
tasks like using an inline for a comment form on each new blog post.

This feature would also allow the automatic inclusion of a given template in
every new post, which could help for [[/plugins]] (automatically use the
plugin template), or for [[/bugs]] and [[todo_items|/todo]] (automatically use
a template that appends "(done)" to the title if the page links to
"done"). --[[JoshTriplett]]

> This is a feature I miss a lot from MoinMoin, and is especially helpful when you maintain pages which have a regular format (eg. recipe pages).  I understand that using svn would bypass this feature but I think it's worth considering anyway because:

> * It's remote and casual users who benefit most from having standard templates to use for new pages
> * When using svn to make changes it's easier to manually provide template functionality (eg. cp recipe_template.mdwn newpage.mdwn)
