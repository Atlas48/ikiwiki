Along the same lines as having a [[default_name_for_new_post]]s, an option
to include default content in a new [[plugins/inline]] post would help with
tasks like using an inline for a comment form on each new blog post.

This feature would also allow the automatic inclusion of a given template in
every new post, which could help for [[/plugins]] (automatically use the
plugin template), or for [[/bugs]] and [[todo_items|/todo]] (automatically use
a template that appends "(done)" to the title if the page links to
[[bugs/done]] or [[todo/done]], respectively. --[[JoshTriplett]]
