I would find the [[plugins/brokenlinks]] listing much easier to use if it
grouped all the links to a single missing page on one line, rather than showing
one line per page that links to the missing page.

I think this would work well as the default; however, if people prefer the
current behavior, perhaps brokenlinks could have an option to group by link
target.
