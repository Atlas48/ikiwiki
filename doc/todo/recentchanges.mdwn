* Why isn't it statically-genereated, but generated dynamically by CGI? It
  seems like it could be beneficial to have it rendered in the post-commit
  hook, just like everything else in the wiki.

* Also, is it planned/desired that recent changes generate the same
  information in RSS feed format? This seems like it could be a useful way
  to keep track of the wiki as a whole.

* Lastly, would it be possible to use the recent changes code with a
  pagespec? I understand this sort of infringes on territory covered by the
  inline plugin, but the inline plugin only puts a page in the RSS feed
  once, when it's created, and I imagine some people -- some deranged,
  obsessive-compulsive people like myself -- would like to know about the
  changes made to existing pages as well as newly-created pages.
