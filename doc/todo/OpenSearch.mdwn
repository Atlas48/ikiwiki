[[plugins/search]] could provide [OpenSearch](http://www.opensearch.org/)
metadata.  Various software supports OpenSearch (see the Wikipedia article on
[[wikipedia OpenSearch]]); in particular, browsers like Firefox and Iceweasel
will automatically discover an OpenSearch search and offer it in the search
box.

More specifically, we want to follow the [OpenSearch Description Document
standard](http://www.opensearch.org/Specifications/OpenSearch/1.1#OpenSearch_description_document),
by having a `link` with `rel="search"` and
`type="application/opensearchdescription+xml"` in the headers of HTML, RSS,
and Atom pages.  The `href` of that `link` should point to an
OpenSearchDescription XML file with contents generated based on the
information in `ikiwiki.setup`, and the `title` attribute of the `link` should
contain the wiki title from `ikiwiki.setup`.
