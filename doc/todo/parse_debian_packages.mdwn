A parser, similar in functionality to [[plugins/inline]] that would find
and parse debian packages from a repository and include links to
them. Functionality would be similar to the
[PHP Apt-file parser](http://php-apt-parser.alioth.debian.org/)
(for an example of the output, see
[my repository](http://debian.camrdale.org/)). This would create
a helpful index page to a small repository, listing all the
packages, and possibly their descriptions as well, with links to
download them or their sources.

I think this is easily possible (and I might be able to work on
it myself, though Perl is not my strong suit). The trickiest
part is probably figuring out how and when to parse the packages.
The packages could be included in the ikiwiki RCS repository,
which might be difficult when the Packages/Release files need to
be generated (especially if it's via an external tool like
reprepro/debarchiver/etc.). Or, the packages could be kept
separate, with only a link given to the plugin, though changes
would then not be picked up until the ikiwiki is recompiled.

Perhaps a better (though infinitely more complicated) solution
would be to include the reprepro/debarchiver functionality in
ikiwiki. Packages could be posted, like blog entries, and tagged
with the target distribution (sid/lenny/etc.). Then compiling
ikiwiki would generate the needed Packages/Release files
automatically.

Just some thoughts I had, hope it's not too crazy.<br>
