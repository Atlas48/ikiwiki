Rather than copy the basewiki around everywhere, it should be configured to
underlay the main srcdir, and pages be rendered from there if not in the
srcdir. This would allow upgrades to add/edit pages in the basewiki.

Impementaion will be slightly tricky since currently ikiwiki is hardcoded
in many places to look in srcdir for pages. Also, there are possible
security attacks in the vein of providing a file ikiwiki would normally
skip in the srcdir, and tricking it to processing this file instead of the
one from the underlaydir.

There are also difficulties related to removing files from the srcdir, and
exposing ones from the underlaydir. Will need to make sure that the mtime
for the source file is zeroed when the page is removed, and that it then
finds the underlay file and treats it as newer.
