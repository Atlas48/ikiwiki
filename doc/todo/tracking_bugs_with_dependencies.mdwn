I like the idea of [[tips/integrated_issue_tracking_with_ikiwiki]], and I do so on several wikis.  However, as far as I can tell, ikiwiki has no functionality which can represent dependencies between bugs and allow pagespecs to select based on dependencies.  For instance, I can't write a pagespec which selects all bugs with no dependencies on bugs not marked as done.  --[[JoshTriplett]]
