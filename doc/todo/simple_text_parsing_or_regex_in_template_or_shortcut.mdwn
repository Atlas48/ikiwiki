Either [[plugins/template]] or [[plugins/shortcut]] should support some form of very simple text parsing or regex application, to make it possible to write something like `\[[mmlist listname@lists.example.org]]` and have this become <listname@lists.example.org> ([mailman page](http://lists.example.org/mailman/listinfo/listname)).
