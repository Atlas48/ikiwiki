Feature idea: I'd like to be able to tag pages in an ikiwiki blog with a
publication date, and have the option of building a blog that excludes
publication dates in the future.  (meta pubdate= ?)

I'm using ikiwiki on git for a "tip of the day" RSS feed, and I'd like to
be able to queue up a bunch of items instead of literally putting in one
tip per day.  In the future I think this will come in handy for other
Mainstream Media-oriented requirements such as "embargo dates" and "editor
on vacation".
