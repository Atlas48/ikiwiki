summary
=======

Make it easy to configure the Markdown implementation used by the
[[plugins/mdwn]] plugin.  With this patch, you can set the path to an
external Markdown executable in your ikiwiki config file.  If you do
not set a path, the plugin will use the usual config options to
determine which Perl module to use.
