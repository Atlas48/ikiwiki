This sounds like a more general version of what I want for one-photo-per-page galleries, where each page has previous|up|next links (like this plugin) and the index page has a list or grid of thumbnails (\[[!inline]] with a specially modified template perhaps). I'll watch this with interest! --[[smcv]]
