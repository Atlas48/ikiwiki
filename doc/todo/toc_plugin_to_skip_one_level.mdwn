It would be great if I could to this:

     \[[toc levels=3 skip=1]]

I use h1 for big title on each page, and don't want it in my toc on that page.

That way I could have toc for h2 and h3 and h1 is skipped bacause it is big title for many pages.

P.S. I tried to indent "[[toc..." to make it monospaced but it does not work ?
