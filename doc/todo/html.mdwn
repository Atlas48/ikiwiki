Create some nice stylesheets. Make RecentChanges use table for
formatting, and images to indicate web vs svn commits and to link to diffs.

All of this should be doable w/o touching a single line of code, just
editing the [[templates]] and/or editing [[style.css]] BTW.

## html validation

  * Doctype is XHTML 1.0 Strict
    	
	One consideration of course is that regular users might embed html
	that uses deprecated presentational elements like &lt;center&gt;. At
        least firefox seems to handle that mixture ok.

  * [ [inlinepage] ] gets wrapped in &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt; which has a high chance of invalidating the page.

  	Since markdown does this, the only way I can think to fix it is to
	make the inlined page text start with &lt;/p&gt; and end with
	&lt;p&gt;. Ugly, and of course there could be problems with
	markdown enclosing it in other spanning tags in some cases.
	I've implemented this hack now. :-/ --[[Joey]]

	I used this 'hack' myself, but yesterday I came up with a better idea:  
	    &lt;div class="inlinepage"&gt;  
	    [ [inlinepage] ]  
	    &lt;/div&gt;  
	This prevents markdown enclosing and even adds a useful css identifier. Problem is that this should be added to every page and not in the template(s). --[[JeroenSchot]]

	I can make ikiwiki add that around every inlined page easily
	enough. However, where is it docuemented? Came up dry on google.

This page is now valid.
