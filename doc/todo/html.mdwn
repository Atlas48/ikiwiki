Make the html valid. Add css and prettify. Make RecentChanges use table for
formatting, and images to indicate web vs svn commits and to link to diffs.

All of this should be doable w/o touching a single line of code, just
editing the [[templates]] BTW.

Current problems:

  * A doctype should be added: do we want XHTML 1.0 or HTML 4.01 Trans as default?
  * If XHTML: In templates &lt;hr&gt; should become &lt;hr\&gt; etc.
  * Image wikilinks should provide an alt text (maybe '$filname wiki-image'?).
  * &'s in (cgi-)url's must be escaped as &amp;amp;.
  * [ [inlinepage] ] gets wrapped in &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt; which has a high chance of invalidating the page.
