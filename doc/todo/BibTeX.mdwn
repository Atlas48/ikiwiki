I would *love* to see a plugin that lets you create one or more BibTeX-formatted bibliography pages and add citations to other pages.  The plugin could also render the bibliographies themselves using a chosen BibTeX style and an HTML formatter for LaTeX (such as HeVeA).

I work on a plugin to htmlize '.bib' files.

A sample result is shown on my webpage : <http://alexandre.dupas.free.fr/code/pub/>.

It features the htmlization of the bibtex with 4 types of entry supported (InProceedings, Article, MastersThesis and PhdThesis). I will add the book entry support soon. It creates for each '.bib' file an html version, and for each entry a specific page with abstract as well as an individual bib file. It lack some features like the possibility to have a pdf or ps version of the article attached.

This plugin uses two templates to render the html version of each file.

I have a problem to create a new page that render like any other page in the wiki. I have used the Ikiwiki's internal **genpage($$)** routine but I suppose that there is another way to do this. My method lack the backlink support for the individual entry files as well as the modification date of these file.

Is it possible to create several wiki page from only one source file?

The source of this plugin could be found on this page : <http://alexandre.dupas.free.fr/code/ikiwiki/> .

Feel free to propose any modifications to enhance this plugin.

I have not found any other approach to build several wiki page with only one source file. Does someone have an idea?

I also try to build a wiki-wide preprocessing of the source file to find reference to my bib entry (citation) but apparently there is no wiki-wide preprocessing hook allowing to collect data from each page before building the site. Do I miss something?
