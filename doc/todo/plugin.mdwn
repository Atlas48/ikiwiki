Suggestions of ideas for plugins:

* list of registered users - tricky because it sorta calls for a way to rebuild the page when a new user is registered. Might be better as a cgi?
* a [[todo/link_map]]
* [[todo/sigs]] ?
* [[pageindexes]]
* Wiki stats, such as total number of links, most linked to pages
* Support [[RecentChanges]] as a regular page containing a plugin that updates each time there is a change, and statically builds the recent changes list. (Would this be too expensive/inflexible? There might be other ways to do it as a plugin, like making all links to RecentChanges link to the cgi and have the cgi render it on demand.)
* Support for smileys or other symbols. I appreciate the support for check
  marks, etc in other wikis. Needs some free smiley files.
* For PlaceWiki I want to be able to do some custom plugins, including one
  that links together subpages about the same place created by different
  users. This seems to call for a plugin that applies to every page w/o any
  specific marker being used, and pre-or-post-processes the full page
  content. It also needs to update pages when related pages are added,
  so it needs to register dependencies pre-emptively between pages,
  or something. It's possible that this is a special case of backlinks and
  is best implemented by making backlinks a plugin somehow. --[[Joey]]
