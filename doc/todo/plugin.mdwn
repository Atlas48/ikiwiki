Suggestions of ideas for plugins:

* list of registered users - tricky because it sorta calls for a way to rebuild the page when a new user is registered. Might be better as a cgi?
> At best, this could only show the users who have logged in, not all
> permitted by the current auth plugin(s).  HTTP auth would need
> web-server-specific code to list all users, and openid can't feasibly do so
> at all. --[[JoshTriplett]]

* [[sigs]] ?

* Support [[RecentChanges]] as a regular page containing a plugin that
  updates each time there is a change, and statically builds the recent
  changes list. (Would this be too expensive/inflexible? There might be
  other ways to do it as a plugin, like making all links to RecentChanges
  link to the cgi and have the cgi render it on demand.) 

  Or using an iframe
  to inline the cgi, although firefox seems to render that nastily with
  nested scroll bars. :-(

> gitweb's shortlog or summary view would work nicely as a
> RecentChanges. --[[JoshTriplett]]
>>Why not fork the process?  We wouldn't have to wait around for a response since we would assume the recent changes page was being generated correctly.

* It would be nice to be able to have a button to show "Differences" (or 
  "Show Diff") when editing a page. Is that an option that can be enabled?
  Using a plugin?

* For PlaceWiki I want to be able to do some custom plugins, including one
  that links together subpages about the same place created by different
  users. This seems to call for a plugin that applies to every page w/o any
  specific marker being used, and pre-or-post-processes the full page
  content. It also needs to update pages when related pages are added,
  so it needs to register dependencies pre-emptively between pages,
  or something. It's possible that this is a special case of backlinks and
  is best implemented by making backlinks a plugin somehow. --[[Joey]]

* random page (cgi plugin; how to link to it easily?)

* How about an event calendar. Events could be sub-pages with an embedded 
  code to detail recurrance and/or event date/time

* rcs plugin ([[JeremyReed]] has one he has been using for over a month with over 850 web commits with 13 users with over ten commits each.)

* asciidoc or txt2tags format plugins

  Should be quite easy to write, the otl plugin is a good example of a
  similar formatter.

>>Isn't there a conflict between ikiwiki using \[\[  \]\] and asciidoc using the same?
>>There is a start of an asciidoc plugin at <http://www.mail-archive.com/asciidoc-discuss@metaperl.com/msg00120.html>

* manpage plugin: convert **"ls(1)"** style content into Markdown like **\[ls(1)\]\(http://example.org/man.cgi?name=ls&sect=1\)** or into HTML directly.

> With a full installation of groff available, man offers HTML output.  Might
