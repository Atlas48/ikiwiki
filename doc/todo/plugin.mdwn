Suggestions of ideas for plugins:

* list of registered users - tricky because it sorta calls for a way to rebuild the page when a new user is registered. Might be better as a cgi?
> At best, this could only show the users who have logged in, not all
> permitted by the current auth plugin(s).  HTTP auth would need
> web-server-specific code to list all users, and openid can't feasibly do so
> at all. --[[JoshTriplett]]

* It would be nice to be able to have a button to show "Differences" (or 
  "Show Diff") when editing a page. Is that an option that can be enabled?
  Using a plugin?

* For PlaceWiki I want to be able to do some custom plugins, including one
  that links together subpages about the same place created by different
  users. This seems to call for a plugin that applies to every page w/o any
  specific marker being used, and pre-or-post-processes the full page
  content. It also needs to update pages when related pages are added,
  so it needs to register dependencies pre-emptively between pages,
  or something. It's possible that this is a special case of backlinks and
  is best implemented by making backlinks a plugin somehow. --[[Joey]]

* random page (cgi plugin; how to link to it easily?)

* How about an event calendar. Events could be sub-pages with an embedded 
  code to detail recurrance and/or event date/time

* rcs plugin ([[JeremyReed]] has one he has been using for over a month with over 850 web commits with 13 users with over ten commits each.)

* asciidoc or txt2tags format plugins

  Should be quite easy to write, the otl plugin is a good example of a
  similar formatter.

>>Isn't there a conflict between ikiwiki using \[\[  \]\] and asciidoc using the same?
>>There is a start of an asciidoc plugin at <http://www.mail-archive.com/asciidoc-discuss@metaperl.com/msg00120.html>

* manpage plugin: convert **"ls(1)"** style content into Markdown like **\[ls(1)\]\(http://example.org/man.cgi?name=ls&sect=1\)** or into HTML directly.

> With a full installation of groff available, man offers HTML output.  Might

> or might not want to convert pages in the SEE ALSO as
> well. --[[JoshTriplett]]

* As I couldn't find another place to ask, I'll try here. I would like to install some contributed plugins, but can not find anywhere to downlod them.

  > Not sure what you mean, the [[plugins/contrib]] page lists contributed plugins, and each of their pages tells where to download the plugin from.. --[[Joey]]

* I'm thinking about starting a simple LaTeX plugin.  This would be mainly  to convert my old tex4ht based website. Would anyone else find this useful, 
or should I just hack some offline converter together --[[DavidBremner]]
