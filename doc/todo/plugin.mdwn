Suggestions of ideas for plugins:

* list of registered users - tricky because it sorta calls for a way to rebuild the page when a new user is registered. Might be better as a cgi?
* a [[link_map]]
* [[sigs]] ?
* [[pageindexes]]
* Wiki stats, such as total number of links, most linked to pages

* Support [[RecentChanges]] as a regular page containing a plugin that
  updates each time there is a change, and statically builds the recent
  changes list. (Would this be too expensive/inflexible? There might be
  other ways to do it as a plugin, like making all links to RecentChanges
  link to the cgi and have the cgi render it on demand.) 

  Or using an iframe
  to inline the cgi, although firefox seems to render that nastily with
  nested scroll bars. :-(

* For PlaceWiki I want to be able to do some custom plugins, including one
  that links together subpages about the same place created by different
  users. This seems to call for a plugin that applies to every page w/o any
  specific marker being used, and pre-or-post-processes the full page
  content. It also needs to update pages when related pages are added,
  so it needs to register dependencies pre-emptively between pages,
  or something. It's possible that this is a special case of backlinks and
  is best implemented by making backlinks a plugin somehow. --[[Joey]]

* interwiki links

* random page (cgi plugin; how to link to it easily?)

* navigation or side bar plugin, would use a specific page as the side bar
  and include it into the other pages as specified by the template. The
  pagetemplate hook was added to allow for this.

All the kinds of plugins that blogging software has is also a possibility:

* Blog post calendar
* technocrati pinger
* Tag stuff?
