I've extended the google plugin to add support for Google Analytics.
This is done in two steps:

* a `google_sitesearch` config option is introduced, to allow disabling
  sitesearch even when the `google` plugin is loaded
* a `google_analytics_account` config option is introduced. When it's
  defined, its value is assumed to be a Google Analytics account ID
  and the corresponding JavaScript code is automatically inserted in all
  documents. The way this is done is shamelessy stolen from the flattr
  plugin
