It looks like all links in websites are absolute paths, this has some limitations:

* If connecting to website via https://... all links will take you back to http://
* Makes it harder to mirror website via HTML version, as all links have to be updated.

It would be good if relative paths could be used instead, so the transport method isn't changed unless specifically requested.

Errr... That is not a solution, that is a work around. ikiwiki does not hard
code the absolute paths, but absolute paths are hard coded in the configuration
file. If you want to serve your website so that the majority of users can see
it as http, including in rss feeds (this allows proxy caches to cache the
contents and has reduced load requirements), but editing is done via https for
increased security, it is not possible. I have some ideas how this can be
implemented (as ikiwiki has the absolute path to the CGI script and the
absolute path to the destination, it should be possible to generate a relative
path from one to the other), although some minor issues still need to be
resolved. -- Brian May

I noticed the links to the images on <http://ikiwiki.info/recentchanges/> are
also absolute, that is <http://ikiwiki.info/wikiicons/diff.png>; this seems
surprising, as the change.tmpl file uses &lt;TMPL_VAR BASEURL&gt; which seems
to do the right thing in page.tmpl, but not for change.tmpl. Where is BASEURL
set? -- Brian May

So I'm facing this same issue. I have a wiki which needs to be accessed on
three different URLs(!) and the hard coding of the URL from the setup file is
becoming a problem for me. Is there anything I can do here? --[[Perry]]

[[!tag patch]]

For a while I've been using a configuration where each wiki has a HTTP and
a HTTPS mirror, and updating one automatically updates the other, but
that seems unnecessarily complicated. My `https` branch adds `https_url`
and `https_cgiurl` config options which can be used to provide a HTTPS
variant of an existing site; the CGI script automatically detects whether
it was accessed over HTTPS and switches to the other one.

This required some refactoring, which might be worth merging even if
you don't like my approach:

* change `IkiWiki::cgiurl` to return the equivalent of `$config{cgiurl}` if
  called with no parameters, and change all plugins to indirect through it
  (then I only need to change that one function for the HTTPS hack)

* `IkiWiki::baseurl` already has similar behaviour, so change nearly all
  references to the `$config{url}` to call `baseurl` (a couple of references
  specifically wanted the top-level public URL for Google or Blogspam rather
  than a URL for the user's browser, so I left those alone)
