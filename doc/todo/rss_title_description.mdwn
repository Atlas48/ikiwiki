There could be a better way of setting the title and description of the rss feeds. Perhaps 
through the meta plugin, or extra options to the inline plugin.

At the moment The description is the same for all feeds from
a single wiki it seems, and the title is forced to be one word, 
though I don't think it needs to be.

A few pointers and I might be able to implement this myself. -- JamesWestby
