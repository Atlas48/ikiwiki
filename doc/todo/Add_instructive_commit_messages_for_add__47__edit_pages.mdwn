When I added or edited a page, no commit message was written out (Mercurial backend, though I guess it shouldn't matter). This was done for e.g. the `rename` plugin. I made a naive but seemingly working change to `editpage.pm` to add a message.

I modeled the message on `rename.pm`, which used a lowercase initial letter and imperative form of the verb. This is not the case for e.g. the `comment` plugin, which says "Added a comment: ", so I guess there is no strict rule on style in this case.
