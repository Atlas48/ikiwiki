ikiwiki allows to commit changes to the doc wiki over the `git://...` protocol.
It would be nice if there'd be a uniform way to view these changes before `git
push`ing.  For the GNU Hurd's web pages, we include a *render_locally* script,
<http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/render_locally>, with instructions on
<http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/contributing/web_pages.html>, section
*Preview Changes*.  With ikiwiki, one can use `make docwiki`, but that excludes
a set of pages, as per `docwiki.setup`.  --[[tschwinge]]
