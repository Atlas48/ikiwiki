I've taken all the good stuff from the above (now deleted --[[Joey]]) and added the missing hooks. The code hasn't seen a lot of testing, so some bugs are likely yet to surface. Also, I'm not experienced with perl and don't know where I should have used the function `possibly_foolish_untaint`.

> Review of this one:

> * Looks like `rcs_commit` needs a few improvements, as marked TODO
> * `rcs_remove` just calls "rm"? Does darcs record notice the file was removed

> * Is the the darcs info in [[rcs/details]] still up-to-date re this version?
