I'm still trying to optimize ikiwiki for a site using
[[plugins/contrib/album]], and checking which pages depend on which pages
is still taking too long. Here's another go at fixing that, using [[Will]]'s
suggestion from [[todo/should_optimise_pagespecs]]:

If you have P pages and refresh after changing C of them, where an average
page has E dependencies on exact page names and D other dependencies, this
branch should drop the complexity of checking dependencies from
O(P * (D+E) * C) to O(C + P*E + P*D*C). Pages that use inline or map have
a large value for E (e.g. one per inlined page) and a small value for D (e.g.
one per inline).

Benchmarking:

Test 1: a wiki with about 3500 pages and 3500 photos, and a change that
touches about 350 pages and 350 photos

Test 2: the docwiki (about 700 objects not excluded by docwiki.setup, mostly
pages), docwiki.setup modified to turn off verbose, and a change that touches
the 98 pages of plugins/*.mdwn

In both tests I rebuilt the wiki with the target ikiwiki version, then touched
the appropriate pages and refreshed.

Results of test 1: without this branch it took around 5:45 to rebuild and
around 5:45 again to refresh (so rebuilding 10% of the pages, then deciding
that most of the remaining 90% didn't need to change, took about as long as
rebuilding everything). With this branch it took 5:47 to rebuild and 1:16
to refresh.

Results of test 2: rebuilding took 14.11s without, 13.96s with; refreshing
three times took 7.29/7.40/7.37s without, 6.62/6.56/6.63s with.

(This benchmarking was actually done with my [[plugins/contrib/album]] branch,
since that's what the huge wiki needs; that branch doesn't alter core code
beyond the ready/depends-exact branch point, so the results should be
equally valid.)
