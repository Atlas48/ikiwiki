[[!template id=gitbranch branch=jon/remove_action author="[[Jon]]"]]

The "remove" plugin allows one to remove pages via the web, but you first have
to click on 'edit' to get to the 'remove' button. This is a bit
counter-intuitive, and ikiwiki has an action list, so it would be good if
"remove" (and also "rename" for that plugin) added items to the action list.

First cut series of patches in the indicated branch.  A bit more review is
needed, in my tests removals work and are committed to the vcs but
recentchanges isn't regenerated for some reason (probably the constructed `<a>`
link needs to add/adjust the parameters to emulate a formbuilder form
submission more carefully).

I haven't begun on the 'rename' plugin. -- [[Jon]]
