[[tag patch]]

In our team internal wiki, we wish to impose a policy that all edits must have a comment. Patch in [[debbug 450620]].

> Good idea! I also hate empty commit comments, but I know that it's also a matter
> of human mentality. Of course, you can forbid users to commit empty comments,
> but then they can commit so worthless comments like "\*" or "\* blah". --[[PaweÅ‚|ptecza]]

> I don't feel this belongs in ikiwiki core, but would accept a plugin that
> does it. I think that can be done using a formbuilder_setup hook.
> BTW, it wmuld probably be better to validate against a comment_regexp,
> so that when the evil admins notice that /.+/ is absurdly easy for users
> to get around (by using " "), they can tighten it down. --[[Joey]]
