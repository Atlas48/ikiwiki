* list of all missing pages

  This could be its own static pages updated when other pages are updated.
  Perhaps this ties in with the [[pluggablerenderers]]?

* list of registered users, with the names being links to any userpages.

  Could be implemented with a [[preprocessordirective]], which suggests that there needs to be some sort of plugin interface for new preprocessordirectives.
