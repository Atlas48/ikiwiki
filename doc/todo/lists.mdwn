* list of all missing pages

  Could be a [[plugin]].

* list of registered users, with the names being links to any userpages.

  Could be implemented with a [[preprocessordirective]], which suggests that there needs to be some sort of plugin interface for new preprocessordirectives. Although, how to let the wiki know that the page needs an update whever a new user is added?
