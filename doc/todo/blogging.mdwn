- The [[TODO]] page would work better if the first N were shown in full, 
  and then all open items were shown in summary. Maybe add this mode.
- Add Discussion and Edit links at the bottom of each inlined post.
- It would be possible to support rss enclosures for eg, podcasts, pretty easily. 

Here is the last of those items. Using the meta plugin you can give the appropriate 
info, and the enclosure will be added to the entry. It will also add a <link /> tag
at the top, but I don't know if this is necessary. It also includes a fix for
when make is used without PREFIX.
