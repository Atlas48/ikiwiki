- Blog title, author email, copyright info and anything else supported by
  rss should be able to be specified using the meta plugin.
- The [[TODO]] page would work better if the first N were shown in full, 
  and then all open items were shown in summary. Maybe add this mode.
- Add Discussion and Edit links at the bottom of each inlined post.
- It would be possible to support rss enclosures for eg, podcasts, pretty easily.
