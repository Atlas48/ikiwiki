- The [[TODO]] page would work better if the first N were shown in full, 
  and then all open items were shown in summary. Maybe add this mode.
- Add Discussion and Edit links at the bottom of each inlined post.
- It would be possible to support rss enclosures for eg, podcasts, pretty easily. 

Here is the last of those items. Using the meta plugin you can give the appropriate 
info, and the enclosure will be added to the entry. It will also add a <link /> tag
at the top, but I don't know if this is necessary. It also includes a fix for
when make is used without PREFIX.

	Hmm. Not quite how I'd envisioned podcasts would work, my idea was
	more that the sound files would be kept inside the wiki, and the
	inline plugin could be told to eg, inline *.mp3, and would add
	those to the rss feed as enclosures. Maybe you'd also inline some
	regular blog pages to describe the files or the like.

	Do you think that would work or that it's worth pursuing that
	approach? I haven't looked at podcasts enough to know if that
	method would be technically feasable; for one thing it would limit
	the blog items for podcasts to just having an enclosure but no
	description.

	Even if that doesn't work and pages are needed to desribe the items
	like you did, it still seems better to keep the podcast items in
	the wiki..

That's fair enough. I'm a little unsure of how it all works, so I just did the
simplest thing I could. 

You don't need a description for podcasts it seems. So there's nothing stopping
you there. 

I have another patch that I think does what you want. It only supports .mp3 files,
.ogg or similar could be added easily. 

It has the disadvantage that the filename is all there is to go on, as I can't
think of a way to associate any information with the mp3 file. I don't 
want to add a dependency on a IDv3 tag library. You could add another file
.mp3.info with the title/description in. 

It's obviously up to you which way you want to go.

	Hmm, this could be taken a step further, and assume that if
	IkiWiki::pagetype doesn't return a defined page type for the page
	in the blog, then no matter the extension it should be fed into the
	rss feed in an enclosure. This would allow for not only podcasting,
	but vidcasting and a form of photo blogging. Or even an rss feed
	containing the source of ikiwiki. ;-)
