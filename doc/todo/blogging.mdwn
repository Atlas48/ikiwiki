- Should probably add params to control various rss fields like the blog
  title, its author email, its copyright info, etc. 
- The [[TODO]] page would work better if the first N were shown in full, 
  and then all open items were shown in summary. Maybe add this mode.
- Add Discussion and Edit links at the bottom of each inlined post.
- Still not completly comfortable with ikiwiki only knowing when a page was
  posted based on the on-disk mtime the first time it sees the page. svn doesn't
  preserve mtimes and also if the index gets broken it will see new mtimes for any
  pages that were actually modified in the interim. I suppose that info could 
  be pulled out of svn log by a utility that was run if the index or mtimes 
  got screwed up.
- It would be possible to support rss enclosures for eg, podcasts, pretty easily.
