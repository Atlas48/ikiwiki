- The [[TODO]] page would work better if the first N were shown in full, 
  and then all open items were shown in summary. Maybe add this mode.
- Add Discussion and Edit links at the bottom of each inlined post.
- It would be possible to support rss enclosures for eg, podcasts, pretty easily. 

Here is the last of those items. Using the meta plugin you can give the appropriate 
info, and the enclosure will be added to the entry. It will also add a <link /> tag
at the top, but I don't know if this is necessary. It also includes a fix for
when make is used without PREFIX.

	Hmm. Not quite how I'd envisioned podcasts would work, my idea was
	more that the sound files would be kept inside the wiki, and the
	inline plugin could be told to eg, inline *.mp3, and would add
	those to the rss feed as enclosures. Maybe you'd also inline some
	regular blog pages to describe the files or the like.

	Do you think that would work or that it's worth pursuing that
	approach? I haven't looked at podcasts enough to know if that
	method would be technically feasable; for one thing it would limit
	the blog items for podcasts to just having an enclosure but no
	description.
