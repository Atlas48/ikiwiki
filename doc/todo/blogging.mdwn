- Add a small form at top and bottom of a blog to allow entering
  a title for a new item, that goes to a template to create the new page.
- Should probably add params to control various rss fields like the blog
  title, its author email, its copyright info, etc. 
- The [[TODO]] page would work better if the first N were shown in full, 
  and then all open items were shown in summary. Maybe add this mode.
