- Should probably add params to control various rss fields like the blog
  title, its author email, its copyright info, etc. 
- The [[TODO]] page would work better if the first N were shown in full, 
  and then all open items were shown in summary. Maybe add this mode.
- Add Discussion and Edit links at the bottom of each inlined post.
- It would be possible to support rss enclosures for eg, podcasts, pretty easily.
