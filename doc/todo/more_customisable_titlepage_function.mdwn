I understand the `IkiWiki::titlepage` function is used to generate filenames from titles. It would be nice if there were an easier way to override what it does. I suppose I could write an *external* plugin and call `inject`, but maybe this could instead be done via the configuration file?

I imagine two things: a lookup hash and a template.

Since `IkiWiki::titlepage` basically translates characters, it would be cool to be able to define a lookup hash in the configuration, which would be consulted before falling back to the generic `__xx__` `ord()` representation of a letter. For instance, in German, I might prefer to have 'ÃÂ¤' become 'ae' instead of something illegible.

Second, maybe a template could be honoured. The template could have a slot `%s` where the calculated title goes, and it could contain `strftime` symbols as well as variables, which get interpolated on use.

Another option would be a function I could define in the setup file, or an external script, though that would be pretty expensive.
