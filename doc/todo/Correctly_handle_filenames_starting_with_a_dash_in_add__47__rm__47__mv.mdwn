BUG: Creating pages starting with dash(es) in the CGI doesn't add/commit them automatically to the GIT backend repository. This is fixed in the forked repository at <https://github.com/wagnerflo/ikiwiki> in commit [6b0ae40](https://github.com/wagnerflo/ikiwiki/commit/6b0ae40d109c58ae5ca098496ac30c7ef0074131).
