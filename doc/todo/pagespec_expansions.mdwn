A couple of suggestions for improving the usefulness of pagespecs:

* @ to match [^/]* (i.e. all pages exactly one level below this one)
* initial ./ to mean "from the page the pagespec is running from".
  This would require some architectural changes and a change to the
  interface for pagespec_match. What do you think? I have
  lots of pages a/b/c.mdwn that inline "a/b/c/*".
