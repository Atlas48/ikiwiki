Known issues with the [[plugins/comments]] plugin:

* There is some common code cargo-culted from other plugins (notably inline and editpage) which
  should probably be shared
* Previews always say "unknown IP address"
* Add `COMMENTOPENID`: the authenticated/verified user name, if and only if it was an OpenID
* The default template should have a (?) icon next to unauthenticated users (with the IP address
  as title) and an OpenID icon next to OpenIDs
* Should the comments be visually set off more from the page above?
  Rather than just a horizontal rule, I'm thinking put the comments
  in a box like is used for inlined pages.
* Instead of just a link to add a comment, it could have a form to enter
  the title, similar to the form for adding a new blog post.
* If a spammer posts a comment, it is either impossible or hard to clean
  up via the web. Would be nice to have some kind of link on the comment
  that allows trusted users to remove it (using the remove plugin of
  course).
* One can use inline to set up a feed of all comments posted to any page.
  Using template=comments_display they are displayed right. Only problem
  is there is no indication in that template of what page each comment in the
  feed is a comment on. So, if a comment is inlined into a different page,
  I think it should show a link back to the page commented on.
  (BTW, the rss feed in this situation seems ok; there the link element
  points back to the parent page.
