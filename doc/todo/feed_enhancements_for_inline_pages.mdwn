I rearranged my patchset once again, to clearly identify the origin and
motivation of each patch, which is explained in the following.

In my ikiwiki-based website I have the following situation:

* `$config{usedirs}` is 1
* there are a number of subdirectories (A/, B/, C/, etc)
  with pages under each of them (A/page1, A/page2, B/page3, etc)
* 'index pages' for each subdirectory: A.mdwn, B.mdwn, C.mdwn;
  these are rather barebone, only contain an inline directive for their
  respective subpages and become A/index.html, etc
* there is also the main index.mdwn, which inlines A.mdwn, B.mdwn, C.mdwn,
  etc (i.e. the top-level index files are also inlined on the homepage)

With the upstream `inline` plugin, the feeds for A, B, C etc are located
in `A/index.atom`, `B/index.atom`, etc; their title is the wiki name and
their main link goes to the wiki homepage rather than to their
respective subdir (e.g. I would expect `A/index.atom` to have a link to
`http://website/A` but it actually points to `http://website/`).

This is due to them being generated from the main index page, and is
fixed by the first patch: ‘inline: base feed urls on included page
name’. As explained in the commit message for the patch itself, this is
a ‘forgotten part’ from a previous page vs destpage fix which has
already been included upstream.

The second patch, ‘inline: improve feed title and description
management’, aligns feed title and description management by introducing
a `title` option to complement `description`, and by basing the
description on the page description if the entry is missing. If no
description is provided by either the directive parameter or the page
metadata, we use a user-configurable default based on both the page
title and wiki name rather than hard-coding the wiki name as description.

The third patch, ‘inline: allow assigning an id to postform/feedlink’,
does just that. I don't currently use it, but it can be particularly
useful in the postform case for example for scriptable management of
multiple postforms in the same page.

In one of my wiki setups I had a terminating '/' in `$config{url}`. You
mention that it should not be present, but I have not seen this
requirement described anywhere. Rather than restricting the user input,
I propose a patch that prevents double slashes from appearing in links
created by `urlto()` by fixing the routine itself.

The inline plugin is also updated (in a separate patch) to use `urlto()`
rather than hand-coding the feed urls. You might want to keep this
change even if you discard the urlto patch.
