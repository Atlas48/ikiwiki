Many plugins seem to create temporary files. Although it is not much code, it is duplicated, and a 
typical place for security bugs.  Would it be worthwhile to have library functions for creating temporary files 
and directories?  If nothing else, it would serve as documentation of the "official way".

Off to cut and paste :-)
