Wishlist: optionally use the [[plugins/contrib/syntax]] plugin automatically on source code files in the repository with recognized extensions or shebangs, and render them as though they consisted of an [[.mdwn|markdown]] page containing nothing but a single call to the syntax plugin with the file contents as the text argument and the recognized type as the type argument.

Together with the ability to have [[wiki-formatted_comments|wiki-formatted_comments_with_syntax_plugin]], this would allow the use of ikiwiki for [[wikipedia literate programming]].
