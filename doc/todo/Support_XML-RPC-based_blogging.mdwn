Perhaps ikiwiki should support XML-RPC-based blogging, using the [standard
MetaWeblog protocol](http://www.xmlrpc.com/metaWeblogApi).  This would allow
the use of applets like [[debpkg gnome-blog]] to post to an ikiwiki blog.  The
protocol supports multiple blog names, so one standard URL with page names as
blog names would work. --[[JoshTriplett]]
