The [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) site uses markdown for markup.
It has a fancy javascript thing for showing a real-time preview of what the user
is editing. It would be nice if ikiwiki could support this, too. The thing they
use on StackOverflow is supposed to be free software, so it should be easy to
add to ikiwiki.

Note that the WMD plugin does **not** handle directives.  For this reason the normal `preview` button
remains.  Some CSS to clean up the display of the live WMD preview would be good.
