The [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) site uses markdown for markup.
It has a fancy javascript thing for showing a real-time preview of what the user
is editing. It would be nice if ikiwiki could support this, too. The thing they
use on StackOverflow is supposed to be free software, so it should be easy to
add to ikiwiki.

### Instructions:


Download the [WMD source](http://wmd-editor.com/downloads/wmd-1.0.1.zip).  In that zip file you'll
find a few example html files, a readme and `wmd` directory.  Move the `wmd` directory into the
ikiwiki `underlays` directory.  You should now have an `underlays/wmd/wmd.js` file as well as 
some other javascript files and an images directory in the same place.

> So, I wonder if I should add a copy of the WMD source to ikiwiki, or rely

> for Debian yet. Hmm, I also can't find any copyright or license info in
> the zip file. --[[Joey]] 

Note that the WMD plugin does **not** handle directives.  For this reason the normal `preview` button
remains.  Some CSS to clean up the display of the live WMD preview would be good.

> Can you elucidate the CSS comment -- or will it be obvious what you mean

Install the following patch and plugin file.  Then enable the 'wmd' plugin.
