The [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) site uses markdown for markup.
It has a fancy javascript thing for showing a real-time preview of what the user
is editing. It would be nice if ikiwiki could support this, too. The thing they
use on StackOverflow is supposed to be free software, so it should be easy to
add to ikiwiki.

### Instructions:


Download the [WMD source](http://wmd-editor.com/downloads/wmd-1.0.1.zip).  In that zip file you'll
find a few example html files, a readme and `wmd` directory.  Move the `wmd` directory into the
ikiwiki `underlays` directory.  You should now have an `underlays/wmd/wmd.js` file as well as 
some other javascript files and an images directory in the same place.

> So, I wonder if I should add a copy of the WMD source to ikiwiki, or rely
> on the user or distribution providing it. It does not seem to be packaged
> for Debian yet. --[[Joey]] 

>> This is a good question.  My thought is that it will probably not be packaged any time soon,
>> so you're better off adding it to IkiWiki.  I'd contact the author of WMD and ask them.  They
>> may have more insight.  -- [[Will]]

Note that the WMD plugin does **not** handle directives.  For this reason the normal `preview` button
remains.  Some CSS to clean up the display of the live WMD preview would be good.

> Can you elucidate the CSS comment -- or will it be obvious what you mean
> when I try it? Is it what's needed for the live preview? --[[Joey]]

>> In the version of the plugin below, a new `div` is added just below the form.  WMD
>> populates this div with the HTML it generates from the Markdown source.  This is not very
>> pretty at the moment - it appears in the same place as the preview used to, but with no
>> header or anything.  Any standard IkiWiki preview will appear below the WMD live preview.
>> I recommend having a look at <http://wmd-editor.com/examples/splitscreen>
>> for what a little CSS could achieve.  -- [[Will]]

Install the following patch and plugin file.  Then enable the 'wmd' plugin.
