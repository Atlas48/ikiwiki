Hi, I would like to have my htaccess files in svn repository so ikiwiki would export that file to my webspace with every commit.

That way I have revision control on that file too. That may be a security concern, but I trust everybody that has svn commit
access and such .htaccess files should not be accessible through wiki cgi. Of course, it could default to 'off'.
