`add_autofile` is a generic version of [[plugins/autoindex]]'s code,
so the latter should probably use the former. --[[smcv]]

I'm having trouble fixing this:

	# FIXME: some of this is probably redundant with add_autofile now, and
	# the rest should perhaps be added to the autofile machinery

By "a generic version of" above, it seems I mean "almost, but not
quite, entirely unlike". I tried digging through the git history for the
reasoning behind the autofile and autoindex implementations, but now I'm
mostly confused.

The autofile machinery records a list of every file that has ever been proposed
as an autofile: for instance, the tag plugin has a list of every tag that
has ever been named in a \[[!tag]] or \[[!taglink]], even if no file was
actually needed (e.g. because it already existed). Checks for files that
already exist (or whatever) are deferred until after this list has been
updated, and files in this list are never auto-created again unless the wiki
is rebuilt.

The autoindex machinery records a more complex set. Items are added to the
set when they are deleted, but would otherwise have been added as an autoindex
(don't exist, do have children (by which I mean subpages or attachments),
and are a directory in the srcdir). They're removed if this particular run
wouldn't have added them as an autoindex (they exist, or don't have children).

Still researching why there's this difference, and whether one or the other
would be better for all cases...
