You can turn any page on this wiki into a weblog by inserting a
[[PostProcessorDirective]]. Like this:

\\[[inline pages="blog/* !*/Discussion" show="10" rootpage="blog"]]

Any pages that match the specified [[GlobList]] (in the exaple, any
[[SubPages]] of "blog") will be part of the blog, and the newest 10
of them will appear in the page.

The optional `rootpage` setting tells the wiki that new posts to this blog
should default to being [[SubPages]] of "blog", and enables a form at the
top of the blog that can be used to add new items.

If you want your blog to have an archive page listing every post ever made
to it, you can accomplish that like this:

\\[[inline pages="blog/* !*/Discussion" archive="yes"]]

You can even create an automatically generated list of all the pages on the
wiki, with the most recently added at the top, like this:

\\[[inline pages="* !*/Discussion" archive="yes"]]
