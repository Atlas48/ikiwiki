Ikiwiki allows turning any page into a [weblog](https://www.listango.com/blog), by using the
[[ikiwiki/directive/inline]] [[ikiwiki/directive]]. For example:

	\[[!inline pages="blog/* and !*/Discussion" show="10" rootpage="blog"]]




Ok, great thank you I was looking to deep. I have managed to assign it to a class but the only problem I am experiencing now is when I assign a article to "technology" than go back out and click on my " technology" on my main parent class menu item it will not display in "technology" the way I would like all I would like to do is just organize the blogs into sections where I would assign them parent classes and have them show up when clicked on by the visitor like to click on "technology" on my menu bar and have that person dive into [blog](https://readingpack.com/blog) relevant to that category

something like [newsylicious.com](http://newsylicious.wordpress.com/) may be a great example of my goal...when you hover over TECH. with your mouse the menu drops down and when you click on the context you're interested in it will take you to that page along with other topics relevant to TECH.
