The thread posted above suggests using pandoc. This unfortunately has many bad side effects.

I wrote a tutorial discussing the options involved here: [[http://wiki.math.cmu.edu/iki/wiki/tips/20130930-ikiwiki/010-setup.html]]. (I post lecture notes regularly, so use the first method suggested there often and find it works quite well.)
