Ok, I'm confused.  See http://lovesgoodfood.com/jason/tags/napowrimo/ and http://lovesgoodfood.com/jason/tags/NaPoWriMo/ for two examples of not picking up pages quite right.  I didn't realize that tags are randomly case-sensitive while still capitalized in the output title?  See the list of backlinks on each.  Also, the only pages actually being ''listed'' are from a year ago, but the backlinks include current pages.  The posts ''are'' being included on http://lovesgoodfood.com/jason/tags/poetry/ .  The feeds are populated on my host, but not on my laptop (Debian unstable-ish, as opposed to a git pull on my host).

Halp?  I've blown away the old (including .ikiwiki) and rebuilt to no effect.  The tag pages are meant to be transients (loaded by default, according to the docs?), but they're still being created.  Nothing seems quite correct.
