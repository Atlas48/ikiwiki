I'm trying to use ikiwiki for the first time. In the start, I had problems
with installing the package, because I don't have a root account on my
server.

When I solved this, I finally set up my wiki, but whenever I try to edit a
page, I get an error: “Error: bad page name”.

What am I doing wrong? The wiki is at
<http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~onderka/wiki/>, the setupfile I used at
<http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~onderka/wiki/ikiwiki.setup>.

> Your setup file seems fine.
> We can figure out what is going wrong through a series of tests:

> * Test if your perl has a problem with matching alphanumerics:
>   `perl -le 'print int "index"=~/^([-[:alnum:]+\/.:_]+)$/'`
> * Check if something is breaking pruning of disallowed files:
>   `perl -le 'use IkiWiki; %config=IkiWiki::defaultconfig(); print ! IkiWiki::file_pruned("index")'`
