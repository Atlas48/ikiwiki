I'm trying to use ikiwiki for the first time. In the start, I had problems with installing the package, because I don't have a root account on my server.

When I solved this, I finally set up my wiki, but whenever I try to edit a page, I get an error: “Error: bad page name”.

What am I doing wrong? The wiki is at <http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~onderka/wiki/>, the setupfile I used at <http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~onderka/wiki/ikiwiki.setup>.
