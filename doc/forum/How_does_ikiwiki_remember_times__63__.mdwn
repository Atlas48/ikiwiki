This is similar to the last post in this forum. I want to know exactly how ikiwiki remembers the times associated with pages, especially when using it for blogging, so I know whether I can trust it or not. From that last thread, I think what ikiwiki does is this:

*   The created time of a file is when that file was first committed into the versioning repository (in my case git)
*   The modified time of a file is what that file was last updated in the repository

And with a blog, by default, the posts are ordered by creation time, although an option can order them by modified time.

Okay. So this should mean that the times are safe if, for example, I delete my working copy and then clone another one from the bare git repository, or otherwise mess up the creation times and mtimes stored as file metadata on the filesystem.

Do I have it right?
