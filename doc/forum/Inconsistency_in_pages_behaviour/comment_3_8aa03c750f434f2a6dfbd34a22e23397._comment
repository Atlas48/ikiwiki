I removed /home/public (the wiki build destination) and rebuilt it, re-enabled po plugin with \"`* or */* or */*/* or */*/*/*`\" in its pagespec settings, but it still only picks up root level pages. Subpages are not marked as translatable. This is a problem.

The backlinks issue seems to have resolved itself after doing this.
