What is the way to tell wrappers that PERL5LIB should include ~/bin directories?

Having this in the wiki.setup doesn't help anymore:

        # environment variables
        ENV => {
          PATH => '/home/user/bin/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/games:/home/user/ikiwiki/usr/bin/:/home/user/ikiwiki/usr/sbin/:/home/user/bin/bin/:~/bin/bin/',
          PERL5LIB => '/home/user/bin/share/perl/5.10.0:/home/user/bin/lib/perl/5.10.0'
        },

Or at least I get CGI errors and running ikiwiki.cgi manually fails too:

        Use of uninitialized value $tainted in pattern match (m//) at /usr/share/perl5/IkiWiki.pm line 233.
        Argument "" isn't numeric in umask at /usr/share/perl5/IkiWiki.pm line 139.
        Undefined subroutine &IkiWiki::cgierror called at /home/user/bin/bin/ikiwiki line 199.

Server has an older ikiwiki installed but I'd like to use a newer version from git, and I don't have root access.
