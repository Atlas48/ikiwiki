This isn't my working repository (on my system it's called notebook, and I created it by: git clone wiki.git notebook presumably I could fix that one by editing config, once the other is working) this is the root repository.  When I created my ikiwiki, it created 3 things in my home directory: wiki, wiki.git and wiki.setup.  It's the wiki.git folder that is causing trouble.
