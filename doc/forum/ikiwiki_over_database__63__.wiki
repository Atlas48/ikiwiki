Is there here any possibility to modifying ikiwiki (via plugin) for store pages in database. I'm thinking about storing pages in sqlite or mysql for serving it much faster. The idea is from sputnik.org [http://sputnik.freewisdom.org/] but with perl ;-). Could we integrate the sputnik code in ikiwiki as a solution?
