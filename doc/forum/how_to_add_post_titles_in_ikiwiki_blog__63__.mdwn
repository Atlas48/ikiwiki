Look at these two blogs:

1) http://ciffer.net/~svend/blog/

2) http://upsilon.cc/~zack/blog/

Well, i set up successfully my blog /i am using inline function in a wiki page) but i have manually to insert blog pos titles and the result is that of blog #2.
Instead i would like to have blog post titles automatically inserted like blog #1 (and they are links too! I want them that way).
I looked in git repo of the two blogs but i couldn't find the answer.
Any help wuold be appreciated.

Thanks

Raf
