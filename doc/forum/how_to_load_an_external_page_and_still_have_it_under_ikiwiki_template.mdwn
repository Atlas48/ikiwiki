OK, probably title is bit confusing. Basically I'd like to be able to keep my left hand side menu, which is part of the template, and at the same time load let's say forum on the right hand side, which sits on a separate domain. Is it possible then to construct template that for some special links it runs as lets say in *frameset* mode?
