just finished setting up ikiwiki..

I can type chinese, save and display it correctly in ikiwiki for the first time. However, when i try to edit the page again, the chinese character in the form is unrecognizable. you can see it here <http://ikiwiki.perlchina.org/>

I am using the latest ikiwiki(manually installed as non-root user) and CGI::FormBuilder(3.0501) on Debian 4.0

这个没问题 it is not a problem on ikiwiki website though.

Thanks.
