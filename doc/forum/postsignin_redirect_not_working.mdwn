I'm confused. I got a plugin working that allows a button to call up a login screen but I can't seem to get it to return to the calling page. I end up on the prefs page.

When the plugin first runs it puts the http_referer into a param:

    $session->param("postsignin" => $ENV{HTTP_REFERER} );

Then when it runs for postsignin its supposed to pull it out and send the user to the original page:

    my $page=$q->param("postsignin");
    ...
    IkiWiki::redirect($q, $page);
    exit;

Full code is available on the plugin page: [[plugins/contrib/justlogin]].

I searched the site and there's very little info available for postsignin or redirect. Perhaps I'm using the wrong function?
