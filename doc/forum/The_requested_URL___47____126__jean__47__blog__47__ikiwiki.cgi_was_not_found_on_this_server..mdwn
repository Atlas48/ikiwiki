Hi,
Installed ikiwiki on my ubuntu (04.10) box; after creating a blog according to your setup instructions I cannot edit files on the web interface, and I get this errer «The requested URL /~jean/blog/ikiwiki.cgi was not found on this server.»
I have no idea what to do (sorry for my ignorance)

tia,
