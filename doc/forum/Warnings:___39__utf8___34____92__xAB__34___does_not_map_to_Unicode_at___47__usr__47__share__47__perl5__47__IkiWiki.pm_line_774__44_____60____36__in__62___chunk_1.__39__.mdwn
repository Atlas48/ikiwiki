# getting Warnings about UTF8-Chars.

I'm  getting multiple warnings:

      utf8 "\xAB" does not map to Unicode at /usr/share/perl5/IkiWiki.pm line 774, <$in> chunk 1.


I'm assuming this is once per File, but even in verbose mode, it doesn't tell me which file is a problem.
It first reads all the files, and afterwards when parsing/compiling them, it outputs the warning, so I can't
deduce the offending files.

Is there a way to have ikiwiki output the position, where it encounters the character?

Probably all this has to do with locale-settings, and usage of mixed locales in a distributed setup ...
I'd rather cleanup some of the file(name)s  of unexpected characters. --[[jwalzer]]
