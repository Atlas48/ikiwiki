This exact same problem has been stopping me from using Ikiwiki locally.  I'm still able to push to remote Ikiwiki instance.  But I'd like to push it to local repo and have the website built locally first so I can confirm everything runs fine.  Everytime I try to build it locally, i have this exact same problem.
