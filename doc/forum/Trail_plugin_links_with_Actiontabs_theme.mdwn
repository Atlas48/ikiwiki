I'm using the trail plugin with the actiontabs theme, and the prev/next buttons
seem to appear in a strange way on the page.

I use modified CSS, but it changes just the colors and some font sizes, but
nothing related to positions and trails.

Here's an example - the top prev/next links appear above the action tabs.
Is this normal? I'm using the ikiwiki version from Debina 7 stable.

- If you use OpenNIC: <http://www.partager.null/tools/systems/admin-guides/ssl/Preparing_the_Tools/>
- If you don't (will work only until the IP changes): <http://85.65.55.38/tools/systems/admin-guides/ssl/Preparing_the_Tools/>

I can look at the CSS and try to figure this out, but I don't know much CSS or
how the trail plugin works. If anyone uses trails, especially with actiontabs, and
can help me - it will be great.

Thanks in advance!
