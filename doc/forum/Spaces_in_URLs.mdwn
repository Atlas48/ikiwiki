There is one file on my site that had a space in the name;
on my old site, this link worked:
[http://dada.pink/scarsdale/Statement 20140527.pdf](http://dada.pink/scarsdale/Statement 20140527.pdf)

Now that I've moved to Ikiwiki, that doesn't work. So I moved the file here:
[http://dada.pink/scarsdale/Statement_20140527.pdf](http://dada.pink/scarsdale/Statement_20140527.pdf)

Is there a better approach to maintaining this link than setting an alias in Apache?
