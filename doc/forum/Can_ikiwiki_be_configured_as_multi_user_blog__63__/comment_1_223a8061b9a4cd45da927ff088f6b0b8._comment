Ikiwiki is a wiki, so you can certainly have multiple users. Any user
with appropriate access can create any number of blogs: they just need
to put an [[ikiwiki/directive/inline]] directive on any page they can
edit.

If you want \"most\" users to *only* be able to write on their own blog,
and not on other users' blogs (for instance: Alice the wiki admin
can edit anything, but Bob can only edit /users/bob/... and Chris can
only edit /users/chris/...) then you can use [[plugins/lockedit]],
something like:

    locked_pages: * and !(user(bob) and (users/bob or users/bob/*)) and !(user(chris) and (users/chris or users/chris/*))

(Wiki admins can always edit locked pages.)

If you have lots of users and you know a bit of Perl, you might want to
[[plugins/write|write a plugin]] that adds a function-like [[ikiwiki/PageSpec]]
like `owndirectory(users)`, which would match if there is a logged-in user
and the page being edited is equal to or a subpage of their directory in
`users`.
