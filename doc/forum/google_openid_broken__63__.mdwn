when I login via to this wiki (or ours) via Google's OpenID, I get this error:

Error: OpenID failure: no_identity_server: The provided URL doesn't declare its OpenID identity server. 

Any idea how to fix this??

> Google is [doing things with openid that are not in the spec](http://googledataapis.blogspot.com/2008/10/federated-login-for-google-account.html)
