The attachments do not seem to get attached to the page, if the page has a space in the name.

For comparability with a wiki I had imported content from I adjusted the `wiki_file_chars` to `wiki_file_chars: '-[:alnum:]+/._ '`.

Attachments work work fine when being attached to a page that matches `'-[:alnum:]+/._'`, but if you have a space in the page name attachments fail.
