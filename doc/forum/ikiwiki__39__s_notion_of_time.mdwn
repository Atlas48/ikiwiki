I'm having some difficulties with ikiwiki's notion of time.

For (regular) pages, the *last edited* date is the one where the file
was indeed last modified according to the file system information.
The *created* date (commented out in the HTML) is, at least for
`--getctime` operation, the date, where the file was last registered
as changed with the VCS.

Now, at least with git, the thing is that when you're checking out files,
they'll get the checkout-time's current time stamp.

What I strive for is the following: *created* be the date when the file
(under its current name) was *first* registered with the VCS (which is
more logical in my opinion), and *last edited* be the date the file was
last registered as changed with the VCS, which is the current
`--getctime` *created* date.

This means that I can build the HTML files from different checkouts of the
VCS and they won't differ in the time stamps they contain in the HTML.

What is the rationale for ikiwiki's current behavior with respect to these
time stamps?
