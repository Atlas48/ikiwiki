I'm trying to convert hand written html site to ikiwiki and maintain url compatibility. html plugin with indexpages=1 converts all dir_name/index.html correctly to dir_name urls with wiki/css based content, but somedir/somefile.html files are only accessible as somedir/somefile/. Non .html files seem to accessible with their full paths, for example somedir/pic.jpg from hand written html can be accessed by same path under ikiwiki.

How to make somedir/somefile.html accessible as somedir/somefile.html under ikiwiki?

Thanks,

Thanks, usedirs seems to be just the thing I need.

Actually usedirs didn't do exactly what I want. The old site contains both
somedir/index.html and somedir/somename.html files. With html plugin and 
indexpages=1 the somedir/index.html pages are accessed correctly but 
somedir/somefile.html files not.

With usedirs => 0, somedir/somename.html pages are accessed correctly but
somedir/index.html pages are not. Actually the handwritten somedir/index.html
files were removed on a rebuild:

    $ ikiwiki -setup blog.setup -rebuild -v
    ...
    removing test2/index.html, no longer built by test2

Is there a way for both index.html and somename.html raw html files to show up through ikiwki?
