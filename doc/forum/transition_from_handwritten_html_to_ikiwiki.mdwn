I'm trying to convert hand written html site to ikiwiki and maintain url compatibility. html plugin with indexpages=1 converts all dir_name/index.html correctly to dir_name urls with wiki/css based content, but somedir/somefile.html files are only accessible as somedir/somefile/. Non .html files seem to accessible with their full paths, for example somedir/pic.jpg from hand written html can be accessed by same path under ikiwiki.

How to make somedir/somefile.html accessible as somedir/somefile.html under ikiwiki?

Thanks,
