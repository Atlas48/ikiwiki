The exact situation that you have described is not currently possible, because
`templatedir` can only have one value. But you can have a very similar practical result
like this:

* Create `/Users/XXX/config/ikiwiki/underlay/` or something (the name is unimportant,
  you can use anything)
* Put your templates in `/Users/XXX/config/ikiwiki/underlay/templates/`
* Include `/Users/XXX/config/ikiwiki/underlay` in the `underlaydirs` configuration
  option (the syntax is the same as `add_plugins`)
