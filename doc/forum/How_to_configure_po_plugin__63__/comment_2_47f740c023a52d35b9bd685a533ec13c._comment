Thanks for reply. I've fixed the installation issue by upgrading.

Now, how do I actually use it?

1) I have existing pages that's in English. I do I add translated versions of some of those pages in the slave language?

2) How do I add new pages with the primary language version and alternative versions in slave languages?

I tried to do these by following instructions at page [po](http://ikiwiki.info/plugins/po), but didn't have much luck.
