I corrected the silly `http:/` typo but it still doesn't work. It issues the following error page when i click \"Preference\" button pointing to `http://foobar.com/pages/ikiwiki.cgi?do=prefs`.

Internal Server Error

The server encountered an internal error or misconfiguration and was unable to complete your request.

Please contact the server administrator, webmaster@foobar.com and inform them of the time the error occurred, and anything you might have done that may have caused the error.

More information about this error may be available in the server error log.

Additionally, a 404 Not Found error was encountered while trying to use an ErrorDocument to handle the request.

But I do know that `/home/USER/foobar.com` is the correct directory for searving `http://foobar.com` as if I put a `test.html` there, `http://foobar.com/test.html` works just fine.

The sysadmin said by default CGI in website folder should work, but I am not sure how I can verify this by some simple test CGI script.

Any ideas?
