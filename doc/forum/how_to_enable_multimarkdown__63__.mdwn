I enabled multimarkdown in my setup file but I get this message 'remote: multimarkdown is enabled, but Text::MultiMarkdown is not installed'.
I also installed multimarkdown-git for my distro (archlinux), which should take care of installing all required perl modules, I believe.
What am I missing?

Thanks.
