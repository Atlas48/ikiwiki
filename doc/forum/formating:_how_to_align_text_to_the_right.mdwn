As in title, how to align text to the right?

> Add to your local.css a class that aligns text to the right:

	.alignright { text-align: right; }

> And then you just just use `<span class="alignright">` around

> Doing this myself and noted that [[markdown]] down does not allow the use of block level elements directly and thus, cannot switch the `span` suggested above for `div` in changing block level elements.  Perhaps the *correct* thing to do here is create a template **but** a workaround I found useful was to over-ride the `inline` nature of the `span` element, as follows
     .align_right { display: block ; text-align: right ; }
> you may also like to remove the padding and margins since they will be provided by the enclosing block.
