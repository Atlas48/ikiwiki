Hello Joey,

I noticed that my Ikiwiki started to rebuild pages very slowly after my last changes
when I upgraded Ikiwiki to version 3.20100623. Now I have the latest release 3.20100704,
but it doesn't help me.

I started to debug the problem and I found that I can see a lot of messages
like below when I try to rebuild my wiki manually:

    svn: '/path/to/ikiwiki/trunk/pages/ostatnie_zmiany' is not a working copy
    svn: Can't open file '/path/to/ikiwiki/trunk/pages/ostatnie_zmiany/.svn/entries': No such file or directory
    svn log exited 256

"ostatnie_zmiany" is a value of `recentchangespage` parameter in my
`ikiwiki.setup` file. It is not under control Subversion I use for Ikiwiki:

    $ svn status pages/ostatnie_zmiany
    ?      pages/ostatnie_zmiany

    $ ls pages/ostatnie_zmiany/*._change |wc -l
    100

`recentchangesnum` parameter has value 100 for me and I noticed that my Ikiwiki
takes a lot of time to parse all `._change` files. Finally it doesn't refresh
/ostatnie_zmiany.html page.

Do you think I should add `ostatnie_zmiany` directory under control of my
Subversion repo? If it's not necessary, could you please give me any hint
to find a reason of problem with my Ikiwiki?

My best regards,
Pawel
