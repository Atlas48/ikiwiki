What is overyone's idea about the ever-growing list of pages in bugs/ etc.?
Once linked to `done`, they're removed from the rendered [[bugs]] page -- but
they're still present in the repository.

Shouldn't there be some clean-up at some point for those that have been
resolved?  Or should all of them be kept online forever?

Likewise, for example in [[forum/ikiwiki__39__s_notion_of_time]], should one
remove the text about the implementation bug that has been fixed, or should it
stay there, for reference?
