Hi all!
I really like ikiwiki and i tested it on my local machine but i have one question that i can't answer reading documentation (my fault of course)...
I have an account and some space on a free hosting service.
Now, i want to put my ikiwiki on this remote web space so that i can browse it from wherever i want.
I have my source dir and my git dir on my local machine.
How can i upload my ikiwiki on the remote host and manage it via git as i can do when i test it locally?
Where is specified? Where can i find documentation about it?

Thanks in advance!

Pab
