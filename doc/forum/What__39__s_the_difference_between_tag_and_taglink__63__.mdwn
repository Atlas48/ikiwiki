It occurred to me the difference between tag and taglink, as described in http://ikiwiki.info/ikiwiki/directive/tag/ is just that the latter enable the option to have a displayed form of the tag different from the tag itself, e.g. a tag `foo` can be displayed as `bar` using 

    \[\[!taglink foo|bar\]\]

Is that it?
