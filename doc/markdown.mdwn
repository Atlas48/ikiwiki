[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
is a minimal markup language that resembles plain text as used in
email messages. It is the markup language used by this wiki.

For documentation about the markdown syntax, see [[HelpOnEditing]] and
[Markdown: syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).

Note that [[WikiLink]]s are not part of the markdown syntax, and are the
only bit of markup that this wiki handles internally.
