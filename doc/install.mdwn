The easiest way to install ikiwiki is using the Debian package, but you can
also [[download]] the source and install it by hand. Ikiwiki should work on
most unix-like systems.

Ikiwiki is a perl program, and needs a recent version of perl such as
5.8.8. (5.8.0 has been reported not to work).

Ikiwiki requires the [[cpan Text::Markdown]], [[cpan URI]],
[[cpan HTML::Parser]], and [[cpan HTML::Template]] perl modules be
installed, and also uses the following perl modules if available: 
[[cpan CGI::Session]], [[cpan CGI::FormBuilder]] (version 3.02.02 or newer),
[[cpan Mail::Sendmail]], [[cpan Time::Duration]], [[cpan TimeDate]],
[[cpan HTML::Scrubber]], [[cpan RPC::XML]], [[cpan XML::Simple]],
[[cpan XML::Feed]], [[cpan File::MimeInfo]].

The [[tla]] support also needs the [[cpan MailTools]] perl module.

Various [[plugins]] use other libraries and utlities; see their individual
documentation for details.

If you want to install from the tarball, you should make sure that the
required perl modules are installed, then run:

	perl Makefile.PL # PREFIX=/dir to install elsewhere
	make
	make test # optional
	make install

See [[download]] for where to get it.
