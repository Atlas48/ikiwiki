The easiest way to install ikiwiki is using the Debian package, but you can
also [[download]] the source and install it by hand. Ikiwiki should work on
most unix-like systems.

Ikiwiki is a perl program, and needs a recent version of perl such as
5.10. (5.8.0 has been reported not to work).

Ikiwiki requires the [[cpan Text::Markdown]], [[cpan URI]],
[[cpan HTML::Parser]], [[cpan HTML::Template]], and [[cpan HTML::Scrubber]]
perl modules be installed. It can also use a lot of other perl modules, if
they are available.

It's recommended you have a C compiler, as ikiwiki uses one to build
wrappers.

Various [[plugins]] use other libraries and utlities; see their individual
documentation for details.

The Debian packages depend on and recommend an appropriate set of packages.

While Fedora 7 doesn't have an ikiwiki package, you can install needed
perl modules using this command:

	yum install perl-Text-Markdown perl-Mail-Sendmail perl-HTML-Scrubber \
	  perl-XML-Simple perl-TimeDate perl-HTML-Template perl-CGI-FormBuilder \
	  perl-CGI-Session perl-File-MimeInfo perl-gettext

If you want to install by hand from the tarball, you should make sure that
all the perl modules are installed. This is one way to install them, using
CPAN:

	PERL5LIB=. PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT=1 perl -MCPAN -e 'CPAN::Shell->install("Bundle::IkiWiki")'
	PERL5LIB=. PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT=1 perl -MCPAN -e 'CPAN::Shell->install("Bundle::IkiWiki::Extras")'

Then to build and install ikiwiki:

	perl Makefile.PL # PREFIX=/dir to install elsewhere
	make
	make test # optional
	make install

See [[download]] for where to get it.
