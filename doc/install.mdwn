The easiest way to install ikiwiki is using the Debian package.

Ikiwiki is a perl program, and needs a recent version of perl such as
5.8.8. (5.8.0 has been reported not to work).

Ikiwiki requires [[MarkDown]] and the `HTML::Parser` perl module be
installed, and also uses the following perl modules if available: 
`CGI::Session` `CGI::FormBuilder` (version 3.02.02 or newer)
`HTML::Template` `Mail::Sendmail` `Time::Duration` `Date::Parse`,
`HTML::Scrubber`, `RPC::XML`, `XML::Simple`, `XML::Feed`.

Various [[plugins]] use other libraries and utlities; see their individual
documentation for details.

If you're installing MarkDown by hand, note that it should be installed as
`Markdown.pm` somewhere in perl's module search path, or alternately as
`/usr/bin/markdown`. Ikiwiki will find it under either name.

If you want to install from the tarball, you should make sure that the
required perl modules are installed, then run:

        perl Makefile.PL # PREFIX=/dir to install elsewhere
        make
	make test # optional
        make install

See [[download]] for where to get it.
