The easiest way to install ikiwiki is using the Debian package, but you can
also [[download]] the source and install it by hand. Ikiwiki should work on
most unix-like systems.

Ikiwiki is a perl program, and needs a recent version of perl such as
5.8.8. (5.8.0 has been reported not to work).

Ikiwiki requires the [[cpan Text::Markdown]], [[cpan URI]],
[[cpan HTML::Parser]], [[cpan HTML::Template]], and [[cpan HTML::Scrubber]]
perl modules be installed.

It also uses the following perl modules if available: [[cpan
CGI::Session]], [[cpan CGI::FormBuilder]] (version 3.05 or newer), [[cpan
Mail::Sendmail]], [[cpan TimeDate]], [[cpan RPC::XML]],
[[cpan XML::Simple]], [[cpan XML::Feed]], [[cpan File::MimeInfo]],
[[cpan Locale::gettext]] (version 1.04 or newer).

It's recommended you have a C compiler, as ikiwiki uses one to build
wrappers.

Various [[plugins]] use other libraries and utlities; see their individual
documentation for details.

The Debian packages depend on and recommend an appropriate set of packages.

While Fedora 7 doesn't have an ikiwiki package, you can install needed
perl modules using this command:

	yum install perl-Text-Markdown perl-Mail-Sendmail perl-HTML-Scrubber \
	  perl-XML-Simple perl-TimeDate perl-HTML-Template perl-CGI-FormBuilder \
	  perl-CGI-Session perl-File-MimeInfo perl-gettext

If you want to install from the tarball, you should make sure that the
required perl modules are installed, then run:

	perl Makefile.PL # PREFIX=/dir to install elsewhere
	make
	make test # optional
	make install

See [[download]] for where to get it.
