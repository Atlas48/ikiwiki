I used IkiWiki to supplant some custom journal software.  I like that it uses
the filesystem, my intent is to make journal entries as future-proof as
possible.  I'll probably start using it for generation of entire sites, soon.

Things generated by IkiWiki with some fancypants stylesheets:

* [woozle.org](http://woozle.org/)
* [My page](http://woozle.org/~neale/)
* [Amy's page](http://woozle.org/~aim/)
* [Heidi's page](http://woozle.org/~heidi/)
