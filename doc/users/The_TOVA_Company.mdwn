We're a small medical software and hardware company. We're based in LA, but all of our developers are up here in Portland. We choose ikiwiki for both our [public web site](http://www.tovatest.com/) and for our internal wikis. We love it, especially based on git: it lets us merge our document repository with our wiki, which is kind of neat.

We're looking for the following "standard" wiki features for some of our git-disabled users:

- Attachments (including renaming/moving/deleting)
- Page renaming/moving/deleting
- inter-wiki links (specifically for having to-do lists for people across multiple wikis)
- Some cleanups on other plugins:
   - Add the ability to use the meta title to the map plugin.
