I'm [tycho](http://www.tychoish.com/). 

I use ikiwiki *a lot* on my local machine to organize thoughts, stage writing projects, and collect information. It's a great thing for me. Someday I'll probably get around to using it to powersome sort of collaborative fiction project. Someday. 

Talk to you soon.
