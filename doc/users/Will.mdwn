I started using Ikiwiki as a way to replace [Trac](http://trac.edgewall.org/) when using [Monotone](http://monotone.ca/).  Version control has been an interest of mine for a while and I wrote most of the ikiwiki [[rcs/monotone]] plugin.

Lately I've been using Ikiwiki for other things and seem to scratching a few itches here and there. :)

I generally use my [[ikiwiki/openid]] login when editing here: <http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~willu/>
