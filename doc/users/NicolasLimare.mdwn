Nicolas (nil) uses ikiwiki on a site/wiki/blog/something... and feels this approach much more comfortable than the usual web-only ones.

He didn't touch any perl code before using ikiwiki, ant that was the first opportunity to propose tiny patches.

Actualy, he would have felt much more comfortable with a python ikiwiki... :)

By the way, I can make translations to french if needed. And maybe to japanese.
