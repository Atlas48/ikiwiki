I'm looking at ikiwiki both for my personal site but also as a
team-documentation management system for a small-sized group of UNIX
sysadmins.

* my edits should appear either as 'Jon' (if I've used
  [[tips/untrusted_git_push]]) or 'alcopop.org/me/openid/'.
* My [homepage](http://jmtd.net/) is powered by ikiwiki (replacing my [older homepage](http://alcopop.org/), which was a mess of scripts)

I gave a talk at the [UK UNIX User's Group](http://www.ukuug.org/) annual
[Linux conference](http://www.ukuug.org/events/linux2008/) about organising
system administrator documentation. Roughly a third of this talk was
discussing IkiWiki in some technical detail and suggesting it as a good piece
of software for this task.
