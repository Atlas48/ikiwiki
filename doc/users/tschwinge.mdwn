With respect to *[[ikiwiki]]* I'm currently working on...

* setting it up for the GNU Hurd's web pages;
* setting it up as a replacement for the GNU Hurd's previous wiki;

... and all that while trying to preserve the previous content's history,
which is stored in a cvs repository for the web pages and whatever backend
TWiki uses for the previous wiki.
