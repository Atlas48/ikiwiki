With respect to *[[ikiwiki]]* I'm currently working on...

* setting it up for the [GNU Hurd's web pages](http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/);
* setting it up as a replacement for the GNU Hurd's previous wiki (TWiki): <http://bddebian.com/~wiki/>;

... and all that while trying to preserve the previous content's history,
which is stored in a CVS repository for the web pages and a RCS repository
for the wiki.

Read [About the TWiki to ikiwiki conversion](http://www.bddebian.com/~wiki/about_the_twiki_to_ikiwiki_conversion/).
