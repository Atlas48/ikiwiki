Had a look at your site. Sprawling, individualistic, using ikiwiki in lots of
ways. Makes me happy. :) I see that I have let a lot of contrib plugins
pile up. I will try to get to these. I'm particularly interested in
your use of yaml+fields. Encourage you to go ahead with any others you
have not submitted here, like pmap. (Unless it makes more sense to submit
that as a patch to the existing map plugin.) --[[Joey]]
