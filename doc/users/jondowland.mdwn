A new ikiwiki user, looking at ikiwiki both for his personal site but also as a team-documentation management system for a small-sized group of UNIX sysadmins.

* My [homepage](http://jmtd.net/) is powered by ikiwiki (replacing my [older homepage](http://alcopop.org/), which was a mess of scripts)

I am giving a talk at the [UK UNIX User's Group](http://www.ukuug.org/) annual [Linux conference](http://www.ukuug.org/events/linux2008/) about organising system administrator documentation which will feature IkiWiki.
