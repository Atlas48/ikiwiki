When you edited [[ikiwikiusers]] all the utf-8 on the page was removed. Is this an issue with the web browser you used? I've fixed the utf-8 damage. --[[Joey]]

> Ooops!  Sorry - yes, my fault - I was using w3m, which spawned nano to edit the text, and I'm not setup for utf-8.  I'll be more careful in future.

> While I have your attention...  I got my asciidoc plugin going, at least well enough to render my website without complaint. If you want to have a look at it, the plugin is at <http://mowson.org/karl/colophon>. Is it worthy of adding to the ikiwiki plugin collection? This is my first ever perl programming, so I may well have made absurd mistakes - if there are things that need changing then I will probably need help/guidance. --KarlMW
