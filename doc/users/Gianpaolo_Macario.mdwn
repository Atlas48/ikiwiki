Just started learning Ikiwiki...

I have been using MediaWiki for a long time, now I would like to switch to Ikiwiki because of:

+ git backend
+ MarkDown syntax

I have browsed <http://www.wikimatrix.org/compare/ikiwiki+MediaWiki>, but I am still not sure about which useful features (if any) I would miss from MediaWiki...

So the best way is to actually trying it, isn't it?
