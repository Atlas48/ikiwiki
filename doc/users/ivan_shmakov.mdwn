&hellip; To put it short: an Ikiwiki newbie.

Currently, I run a couple of Ikiwiki instances.  Namely:

* <http://lhc.am-1.org/lhc/>
  &mdash; to hold random stuff written by me, my colleagues,
  students, etc.

* <http://rsdesne.am-1.org/rsdesne-2010/>
  &mdash; for some of the materials related to the
  &ldaquo;Remote Sensing in Education, Science and National
  Economy&rdaquo; (2010-03-29 &hellip; 2010-04-10, Altai State
  University) program I've recently recently participated in as
  an instructor.
