My name: Scott Bronson

My quest: a wiki that doesn't suck.

My iki: <http://iki.u32.net>

Thanks to [[madduck]], I track this site with the following feed:

[[inline pages="internal(recentchanges/change_*) and !author(http://sabr.myopenid.com/)" 
feedonly=yes rss=no atom=yes]]

Does this bullet go through?  â€¢   yes, of course.

Can I create this page?  [[/root_page_test]]
