I'm currently hosting a private ikiwiki for keeping research notes
which, with some patches and a (currently unreleased) plugin, will
convert inline LaTeX expressions to MathML.  I'm working towards a
patchset and instructions for others to do the same.

There is one thing that needs to be decided first: whether or not to
include [[sanitization|todo/svg]] of MathML in htmlscrubber (and while
we're at it, why not SVG).

My (also MathML-enabled) homepage: <http://jblevins.org/> (still using
Blosxom...maybe one day I'll convert it to ikiwiki...)

Current issues of interest:

 * [[bugs/recentchanges_feed_links]]
 * [[bugs/HTML_inlined_into_Atom_not_necessarily_well-formed]]
 * [[plugins/toc/discussion]]
 * [[todo/BibTeX]]
 * [[todo/svg]]
 * [[todo/Option_to_make_title_an_h1?]]
