Hello, welcome to my page.

There isn't much to say, I'm just a person of the common kind,
trying to make this world a bit better for the next generations :-)

As part of my personal tiny fight for privacy and freedom of speech,
I launched my website via I2P and Tor only. This will probably change soon,
because there's a non-centralized cooperative way to use DNS, but
for now that's all there is. My source code is there too.

I don't remember the .onion address, but this is the I2P eepsite address:

<http://partager.i2p>
