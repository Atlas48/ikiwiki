## online page editing

To support editing pages in a web browser,  a CGI script is needed that
pulls the page out of [[Subversion]], presents it to the user for editing,
and then commits the changed page back to [[Subversion]].

Due to [[WikiSpam]], this will probably also need to incorporate a user
registration system. So there will need to be a script that handles logins
and registrations, sets a cookie, and the page editor can refuse to edit
pages for users who arn't logged in, and include a not of who made the
change in the svn log.

If possible I'd prefer to use someone else's generic web user registration
and login system, if one exists.

## [[RecentChanges]]

This will need to be another cgi script, that grubs through the
[[Subversion]] logs.

This should support RSS for notification of new and changed pages.

## page history

To see past versions of a page, we can either implement a browser for that,
or just provide a way to link to the page in viewcvs.

## pluggable renderers

I'm considering a configurable rendering pipeline for each supported
filename extension. So for ".mdwn" files, it would send the content through
linkify, markdown, and finalize, while for ".wiki" files it might send it
through just a wiki formatter and finalize.

This would allow not only supporting more types of markup, but changing
what style of [[WikiLink]]s are supported, maybe some people want to add
[[CamelCase]] for example, or don't like the [[SubPage/LinkingRules]].

The finalize step is where the page gets all the pretty junk around the
edges, so that clearly needs to be pluggable too.

There also needs to be a step before finalize, where stuff like lists of pages
that linked back to it could be added to the page. However, doing linkbacks
also needs to tie into the main logic, to determine what pages need to be
renered, so maybe that won't be a plugin.

## revist case

Being case insensative is handy, but it does make the [[BackLinks]] a bit
ugly compared to other links. It should be possible to support pagenames
that have uppercase, while still allowing them to be linked to using any
case.
