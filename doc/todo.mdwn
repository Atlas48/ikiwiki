## online page editing

* Missing support for preview.
* Missing conflict detection, just overwrites changes and does not svn up
  first..
* Eventually, might want page deletion.
* Eventually, might want file upload.

## recentchanges

* Should support RSS for notification of new and changed pages. 

  This can be a static rss file that is generated when the moo
is built. (As long as all changes to all pages is ok.)

* Should support mail notification of new and changed pages.

  Hmm, should be easy to implement this.. it runs as a svn post-cookit hook
  already, so just look at the userdb, svnlook at what's changed, and send
  mails to people who have subscribed.

## docs

Need to turn [[usage]] into a man page.
this wiki too. Can markdown generate a man page somehow?

## pluggable renderers

I'm considering a configurable rendering pipeline for each supported
filename extension. So for ".mdwn" files, it would send the content through
linkify, markdown, and finalize, while for ".wiki" files it might send it
through just a wiki formatter and finalize.

This would allow not only supporting more types of markup, but changing
what style of [[WikiLink]]s are supported, maybe some people want to add
[[CamelCase]] for example, or don't like the [[SubPage/LinkingRules]].

The finalize step is where the page gets all the pretty junk around the
edges, so that clearly needs to be pluggable too.

There also needs to be a step before finalize, where stuff like lists of pages
that linked back to it could be added to the page. However, doing linkbacks
also needs to tie into the main logic, to determine what pages need to be
renered, so maybe that won't be a plugin.

## revisit case

Being case insensative is handy, but it does make the [[BackLinks]] a bit
ugly compared to other links. It should be possible to support pagenames
that have uppercase, while still allowing them to be linked to using any
case.

## html

Make the html valid. Add css.

## sigs

Need a way to sign name in page that's easier to type than "-- [[ Joey ]]"
and that includes the date.

What syntax do other wikis use for this? I'm considering "[[ -- ]]" (with
spaces removed) as it has a nice nmemonic.

## recentchanges links to commit diffs

Would take a bit more viewcvs integration, let the be a "[diff]" link in
recentchanges that goes to the diff for any listed change.

## recentchanges more than 100

Possibly add "next 100" link to it, but OTOH, you can just use svn log if
you need that data..
