IkiWiki is the engine driving this wiki, which exists to document ikiWiki.
The [[index]] is where you'll find actual useful info about it.

Why call it IkiWiki? Well, partly because I'm sure some people will find
this a pretty Iky Wiki, since it's so different from other Wikis. Partly
because "ikiwiki" is a nice palindrome. Partly because its design turns
the usual design for a Wiki inside-out and backwards.
