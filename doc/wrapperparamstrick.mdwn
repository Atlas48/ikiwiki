ikiwiki --wrapper can be used to generate a wrapper
program that runs ikiwiki with the specified parameters. This is used for
[[post-commit]] hooks, [[CGI]], etc, both for convenience and because these
things often need suid wrapper scripts to make ikiwiki run as the right
user.

The generated wrapper is a binary program. What if you want to regenerate
it with different parameters, or just run ikiwiki like it would but with
some parameter changed? To easily accomomplish this, the wrappers all
support being run with --params, which causes them to print out the
parameters they run ikiwiki with. 

You can use this trick to regenerate a wrapper, adding or changing a
parameter:

	ikiwiki $(./ikiwiki-wrap --params) --wikiname="newname" --wrapper

Or just to run ikiwiki like the wrapper would, and add a parameter:

	ikiwiki $(./ikiwiki-wrap --params) --rebuild
