##Why?
* Because I can do things like this
* Because I can use my favourite SCM, as the rest of my project elements (that's the only reason I complain about Trac...)
* Because the perfect tool does not exist, but custommizing very simple approaches like this I can build my own
* Because I'm just adding a new topic to see how diff works
