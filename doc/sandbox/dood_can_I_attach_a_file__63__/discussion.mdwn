Probably the place of that question is not the best, because it's a sandbox,
however I think that it's a very good question.

I'm also curious how I can upload read-only files (for example images,
OpenOffice or PDF documents) to my ikiwiki without using `svn add filename`
command?

Does someone know how to do it? -- Pawel
