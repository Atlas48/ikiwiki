This page is a place to document tips and techniques for using ikiwiki.

----

One thing I use ikiwiki for is the web pages for software projects I
maintain. Each of my projects has a news page with an announcements feed,
and to automatically update this when I release a new version, generating
an announcement from the debian/changelog and debian/NEWS files, I use a
[wikiannounce](http://svn.kitenet.net/trunk/bin/wikiannounce) program. It's
somewhat specific to dealing with Debian packages, and uses a special
`announcedir` target in debian/rules, but the general idea could be useful.

I should mention that I also have a
[blog](http://svn.kitenet.net/trunk/bin/wikiannounce) program that I use to
write blog posts in a text editor. The first line I enter is used as the
title, and it automatically comes up with a unique page name based on the
title and handles all the details of posting to my blog. --[[Joey]]
