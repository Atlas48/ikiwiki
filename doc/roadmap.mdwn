This is the roadmap for ikiwiki drevelopment.

# 1.0

Generally usable release.

* No severe [[security]] bugs.
* All the [[features]] people would expect in a wiki. Needs to be a plausable promise of being a wiki that people can commit to [[using|ikiwikiusers]].

Released 29 April 2006.

# 2.0

* Unit test suite (with tests of at least core stuff like
  [[GlobList]]).
* [[Plugins]] 
* [[Tags]]
* Should have fully working [[todo/done/utf8]] support.
* [[Optimised_rendering|todo/optimisations]] if possible. Deal with other scalability issues.
* improved [[todo/html]] stylesheets and templates
* A version of the logo in a different font, possibly with the dots on the i's highlighted in some other color.
* Support for at least one RCS aside from svn. Once it supports two, it should quickly grow to support them all.. See [[about_rcs_backends]]
* Support for one other markup language, probably restructured text.
