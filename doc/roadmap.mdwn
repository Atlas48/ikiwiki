This is the roadmap for ikiwiki drevelopment.

# 1.0

Generally usable release.

* No severe [[security]] bugs.
* All the features people would expect in a wiki. Needs to be a plausable promise of being a wiki that people can commit to [[using|ikiwikiusers]].

Estimated ETA for 1.0 is May 2006.

# 2.0

* Plugin mechanism. See [[todo/PluggableRenderers]]. Should support things like [[todo/lists]] and [[todo/linkmap]].
* Should have fully working [[todo/utf8]] support.
* Optimised rendering if possible. Deal with other scalability issues.
* improved [[todo/html]] stylesheets and templates
