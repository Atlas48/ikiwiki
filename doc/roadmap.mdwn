This is the roadmap for ikiwiki development.

# 1.0

* No severe [[security]] bugs.
* All the basic [[features]] people would expect in a wiki.

Released 29 April 2006.

The 1.x series changed a great deal over the more than 50 releases in its
lifetime. It is now in maintenance mode, only security issues or really bad
bugs will be fixed in 1.x going forward.

# 2.0

* New improved URLs to pages via `usedirs`.
* [[plugins/OpenID]] support, enabled by default.
* Plugin [[interface|plugins/write]] added, with some 60 [[plugins]] available,
  greatly expanding the capabilities of ikiwiki.
* [[Tags]], atom feeds, and generally full-fledged blogging support.
* Fully working [[todo/utf8]].
* Optimisations, approximately 3.5 times as fast as version 1.0.
* Improved scalability to large numbers of pages.
* Improved scalable [[logo]].
* Support for additional revision control systems besides svn: git,
  tla, mercurial.
* Some support for other markup languages than markdown: rst, textile.
* Unit test suite, with more than 300 tests.

Will be released 29 April 2007.

The 2.x series is expected to undergo continuing development for some time,
adding improvements and new features, but avoiding changes that break
backwards compatability.

# future goals

* Improved [[todo/html]] stylesheets and templates.
  _(status: [[css_market]] exists; it could always provide more stylesheets.  No alternate templates yet, though.)_
* Conversion support for existing other wikis.
  (Being worked on for MoinMoin and TWiki by [[Josh_Triplett|JoshTriplett]]
  and Jamey Sharp; support for other wikis should fit into the same
  framework.)
* [[TODO]], [[bugs]], [[soc]], ...
