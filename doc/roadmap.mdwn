This is the roadmap for ikiwiki drevelopment.

# 1.0

Generally usable release.

* No severe [[security]] bugs.
* All the [[features]] people would expect in a wiki. Needs to be a plausable
  promise of being a wiki that people can commit to [[using|ikiwikiusers]].

Released 29 April 2006.

# 2.0

* Unit test suite (with tests of at least core stuff like
  [[PageSpec]]). (status: exists, could of course use more tests)
* [[Plugins]] _(status: done, interface still not quite stable)_
* [[Tags]] _(status: fair)_
* Should have fully working [[todo/utf8]] support. _(status: fair)_
* [[Optimised_rendering|todo/optimisations]] if possible. Deal with other
  scalability issues. _(status: 45%-60%+ speedup since 1.0)_
* Improved [[todo/html]] stylesheets and templates.
* Improved scalable [[logo]]. _(status: done)_
* Support for at least one RCS aside from svn. Once it supports two, it should
  quickly grow to support them all.. See [[about_rcs_backends]]
  _(status: supports git in tree)_
* Support for one other markup language, probably restructured text.
  _(status: done, but need a few more in tree)_
* No serious known [[bugs]]
* No severe-to-moderate known [[security]] issues.
