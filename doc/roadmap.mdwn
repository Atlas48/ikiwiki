This is the roadmap for ikiwiki drevelopment.

# 1.0

Generally usable release.

* No severe [[security]] bugs.

  promise of being a wiki that people can commit to [[using|ikiwikiusers]].

Released 29 April 2006.

# 2.0

* Unit test suite (with tests of at least core stuff like
  [[PageSpec]]). _(status: exists, could of course use more tests)_
* [[Plugins]] _(status: done)_
* [[Tags]] _(status: fair)_
* Should have fully working [[todo/utf8]] support. _(status: good)_
* [[Optimised_rendering|todo/optimisations]] if possible. Deal with other
  scalability issues. _(status: should be faster, need to get numbers)_
* Improved [[todo/html]] stylesheets and templates.
* Improved scalable [[logo]]. _(status: done)_
* Support for at other revision control systems aside from svn.
  See [[about_rcs_backends]] _(status: supports git, tla, mercurial)_
* Support for one other markup language, probably restructured text.
  _(status: done, but the rst plugin needs improvement)_
* No serious known [[bugs]]
* No severe-to-moderate known [[security]] issues.
