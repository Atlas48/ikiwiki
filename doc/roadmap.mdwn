This is the roadmap for ikiwiki drevelopment.

# 1.0

Generally usable release.

* No severe [[security]] bugs. (./)
* All the [[features]] people would expect in a wiki. Needs to be a plausable
  promise of being a wiki that people can commit to [[using|ikiwikiusers]].
  (./)

Released 29 April 2006.

# 2.0

* Unit test suite (with tests of at least core stuff like
  [[PageSpec]]). _(status: exists, could of course use more tests)_
* [[Plugins]] (./)
* [[Tags]] (./)
* Should have fully working [[todo/utf8]] support. (./)
* [[Optimised_rendering|todo/optimisations]] if possible. Deal with other
  scalability issues. _(status: scales to thousands of pages, and approximatly
  3x as fast as version 1.0)_ (./)
* Improved [[todo/html]] stylesheets and templates.
* Improved scalable [[logo]]. (./)
* Support for at other revision control systems aside from svn.
  See [[about_rcs_backends]] _(status: supports git, tla, mercurial)_ (./)
* Support for other markup languages than markdown
  _(status: done with rst, textile, etc. Markdown still works best though.)_
  (./)
* No serious known [[bugs]]
* No severe-to-moderate known [[security]] issues.
* Conversion support for existing other wikis.
  (Being worked on for MoinMoin and TWiki by [[Josh_Triplett|JoshTriplett]] and Jamey Sharp)

2.0 will also be an opportunity to remove old backwards compiatbility
features and make other changes to the default configuration. Some things
I'm considering:

* Making OpenID the default auth method.
* Dropping GlobLists. However, they can lurk in preferences settings in wikis,
  which may make getting rid of them hard, and it may be worth keeping them
  so users can list pages without anding them together.
* Making page/index.html be the default output filename, rather than page.html.
* Enabling goodstuff by default?
* Possibly making PageSpecs match relative by default, rather than the current absolute
  (see [[Discussion]])

Estimated release date for 2.0: 29 April 2007.
