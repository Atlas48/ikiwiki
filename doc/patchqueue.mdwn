Since we have enough people working on ikiwiki to be dangerous, or at least
to duplicate work without coordination, and since few people have direct
commit access to the tree, here's a queue of suggested patches.
Feel free to either copy the patch inline, or link to one elsewhere (or nag
[[Joey]] to open up anonymous svn access to this wiki so you can check in the
patches directly).

[[inline pages="patchqueue/* and !*/Discussion"
feedpages="created_after(enable-htaccess-files)"
rootpage="patchqueue" archive="yes"]]
