Since we have enough people working on ikiwiki to be dangerous, or at least to duplicate work without coordination, and since Joey is still the only one committing directly to the tree, here's a queue of suggested patches. Feel free to either copy the patch inline, or link to one elsewhere (or nag Joey to open up anonymous svn access to this wiki so you can check in the patches directly).

[[inline pages="patchqueue/* !patchqueue/done !link(patchqueue/done) !*/Discussion" rootpage="patchqueue" show="30"]]
