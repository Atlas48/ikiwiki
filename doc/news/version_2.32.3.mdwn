 * [ Josh Triplett ]
   * Do not allow the about: URI scheme; some browsers interpret about:
     URIs like a limited version of data: URIs.  In particular, some
     versions of Internet Explorer interpret arbitrary HTML content in
     about: URIs.
   * Also filter the attributes cite, longdesc, and usemap, which can contain
     URIs.
 * [ Joey Hess ]
   * meta: Check that the urls provided for authorurl, permalink, and openid
     are safe and can't contain javascript.

   * Match literal '.' in URI schemas containing '.', rather than matching any
     character.
   * Do not allow the steam: URI scheme.
   * Allow the snews: URI scheme.
