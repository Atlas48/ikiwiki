   * template: Fix dependency tracking. Broken in version 3.20100427.
   * po: The po\_slave\_languages setting is now a list, so the order of
     translated languages can be controlled. (intrigeri)
   * git: Fix gitweb historyurl examples so "diff to current" links work.
     (Thanks jrayhawk)
   * meta: Allow syntax closer to html meta to be used.
   * Add new disable hook, allowing plugins to perform cleanup after they
     have been disabled.
   * Use Digest::SHA built into perl rather than external Digest::SHA1
     to simplify dependencies. Closes: #[591040](http://bugs.debian.org/591040)
   * Fixes a bug that prevented matching deleted pages when using the page()
     PageSpec."""]]
