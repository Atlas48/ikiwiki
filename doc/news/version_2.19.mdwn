ikiwiki 2.19 released with [[toggle text="these changes"]]
[[toggleable text="""
   * Only try postsignin if no other action matched. Fixes a bug where the
     user goes back from the signin screen and does something else.
   * Improve behavior when trying to sign in with no cookies.
   * Improved the canedit hook interface, allowing a callback function to be
     returned (and not run in some cases) rather than the plugins directly
     forcing a user to log in.
   * opendiscussion: allow editing of the toplevel discussion page,
     and, indirectly, allow creating new discussion pages.
   * Add a prereq on Data::Dumper 2.11 or better, needed to dump q// objects.
   * htmlscrubber: Further work around #365971 by adding tags for 'br/', 'hr/'
     and 'p/'.
   * aggregate: Include copyright statements from rss feed as meta copyright
     directives.
   * aggregate: Yet another state saving fix (sigh).
   * aggregate: Add hack to support feeds with invalidly escaped html entities."""]]
