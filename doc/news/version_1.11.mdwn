ikiwiki 1.11 released with these changes:

   * Patch from Enrico that
     - Adds a tag plugin that allows more easily tagging pages.
       The meta plugin can also still be used for that, but the tag plugin
       also lists a page's tags at the bottom of the page.
     - Allows preprocessor directives to have parameters with no specified
       value.
     - Fixes preprocessor directive parameter parsing so that
       foo=bar baz now means "foo=bar" and a "baz" with no value.
   * Run pagetemplate hooks when inlining pages so that inlined pages also
     list their tags.
   * Make all plugins with pagetemplate hooks check that variables exist
     on the template before setting them, for robustness.
   * Switch pagetemplate hooks to using named parameters.
   * Pass a destpage parameter to preprocessor and pagetemplate hooks.
     This will be the page that a source page will be part of, which is
     different than the source page for inlined pages.
   * Audited all plugins to endure they pass (page, destpage) to htmllink
     appropriatly. This means inlining of various plugins will not work
     properly, with correct links generated.
