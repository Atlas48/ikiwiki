ikiwiki 3.02 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * blogspam: New plugin, adding spam filtering for page editing / comment
     posting using the BlogSpam.net API.
   * Add auto-blog.setup, which will set up an ikiwiki instance tuned for use
     in blogging.
   * checkcontent: New hook, can be used to implement arbitrary content
     filters, including spam filters.
   * table: Fix misparsed links in external files.
   * table: Find links in external files in scan pass.
   * rename: Show full names of affected pages.
   * comments: Fix cache avoidance hack.
   * repolist: New plugin to support the rel=vcs-* microformat.
   * goodstuff: Include repolist by default. (But it does nothing until
     configured with the repository locations.)
   * comments: Add support for removing comments via web interface. (smcv)
   * Consistently allow use of relative paths in all PageSpecs
     that take a page name parameter. Previously, match\_created\_before(),
     match\_created\_after(), match\_sourcepage(), and match\_destpage()
     did not support that, and the docs were not clear.
   * pinger: Get whole url, don't just head, avoids problems on
     the nostromo web server.
   * Recommend libterm-readline-gnu-perl since that makes auto.setup
     behave better."""]]
