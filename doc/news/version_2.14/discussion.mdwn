Hi Joey! Where can I find the source package for ikiwiki 2.14? I rather prefer
`wget` than `git` to download it :) I've just checked
[Debian page of ikiwiki source package](http://packages.debian.org/unstable/source/ikiwiki)
and it seems that it still contains older version 2.13. I didn't found
the latest version at <http://incoming.debian.org/> too. --[[Paweł|ptecza]]

> 2.14 is at the url you cited now. --[[Joey]]
