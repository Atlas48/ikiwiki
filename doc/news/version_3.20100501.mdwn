ikiwiki 3.20100501 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * TMPL\_INCLUDE re-enabled for templates read from the templatedir.
     (But not in-wiki templates.)
   * Version dependency on liburi-perl to &gt;= 1.36; previous versions
     did not support building urls from utf-8 strings. Closes: #[579713](http://bugs.debian.org/579713)
   * Ikiwiki can be configured to generate html5 instead of the default xhtml
     1.0. The html5 output mode is experimental, not yet fully standards
     compliant, and will be subject to rapid change.
   * htmlscrubber: Allow html5 semantic tags: section, nav, article, aside
     hgroup, header, footer, figure, figcaption, time, mark
   * htmlscrubber: Also allow some other html5 tags: canvas, progress, meter,
     ruby, rt, rp, details, summary, datalist.
   * htmlscrubber: Round out html5 video support with the preload
     attribute and the source tag.
   * htmlscrubber: Allow the html5 form attributes: placeholder, autofocus,
     min, max, step, required, autocomplete, novalidate, pattern, list,
     and form. (Also the form* override attributes for input and buttons.)
   * htmlscrubber: Allow additional misc html5 attributes: reversed,
     spellcheck, and hidden.
   * template: Fix typo."""]]
