   * Corrected a typo in an error handler in the image plugin.
   * Allow svnpath config option to contain additional extra slashes anywhere

     normalisation of configs etc can do so.
   * Patch fixing various additional problems with test suite. Closes: #[425891](http://bugs.debian.org/425891)
     once more.
   * French update from Jean-Luc Coulon. Closes: #[430771](http://bugs.debian.org/430771)
   * Correct a longstanding bug that could cause the edit form to be empty.
