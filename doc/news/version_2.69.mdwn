ikiwiki 2.69 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * Avoid multiple ikiwiki cgi processes piling up, eating all memory,
     and thrashing, by making the cgi wrapper wait on a cgilock.
     If you had to set apache's MaxClients low to avoid ikiwiki thrashing your
     server, you can now turn it up to a high value.
   * Stop busy-waiting in lockwiki, as this could delay ikiwiki from waking up
     for up to one second. The bailout code is no longer needed after above
     change.
   * Remove support for unused optional wait parameter from lockwiki.
   * aggregate: Try to query XML::Feed for the base url when derelevatising
     links. Since this needs the just released XML::Feed 0.3, as well
     as a not yet released XML::RSS, it will fall back to the old method
     if no xml:base info is available.
   * meta: Plugin is now enabled by default since the basewiki uses it.
   * txt: Do not encode quotes when filtering the txt, as that broke
     later parsing of any directives on the page.
   * Fix the link() pagespec to match links that are internally recorded as
     absolute.
   * Add rel=nofollow to recentchanges\_links for the same (weak) reasons it
     was earlier added to edit links.
   * tag: Normalize tagbase so leading/trailing slashes in it don't break
     things.
   * bzr: Fix dates for recentchanges."""]]
