News for ikiwiki 3.01:

   If your wiki uses git, and you have a `diffurl` configured in
   its setup file, you should be aware that gitweb has stopped
   supporting the url form commonly used for the `diffurl`.
   You can change your setup to use the newer gitweb url form:
     http://git.example.com/gitweb.cgi?p=wiki.git;a=blobdiff;f=[[file]];h=[[sha1\_to]];hp=[[sha1\_from]];hb=[[sha1\_commit]];hpb=[[sha1\_parent]]
   The changes from the old form are the addition of the `hpb` parameter,
   and the change to the value used for the `hb` parameter.
