ikiwiki 1.28 released with these changes:

   * inline: Add ability to sort by page name, based on a patch from
     Benjamin A'Lee.
   * Fix a forkbomb in various calls to IPC::Open2, which has a highly
     braindead interface. Closes: #[389383](http://bugs.debian.org/389383)
   * Don't rm -rf ikiwiki on distclean, since a) there's no such file
     and b) those poor Mac OSX users and their case insensative files!
   * Don't fail syntax check if Text::Typography isn't installed.
     Closes: #[389406](http://bugs.debian.org/389406)
