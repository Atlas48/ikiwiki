ikiwiki 1.46 released with [[toggle text="these changes"]]
[[toggleable text="""
   * Fix a bug with inlined create page links, including Discussion links on
     blog post pages. The links will now create pages relative to the page that
     actually contains the link.
   * French update. Closes: #[414597](http://bugs.debian.org/414597)
   * Fix some broken logic in cgi creation of a subpage when a toplevel page
     with the same name already exists, and generally simplify the edit code.
   * Make ikiwiki -verbose -setup with a setup file that enabled syslog logging
     output the verbose build log to stdout, rather than to the syslog.
   * Detect the case of two people independently creating the same page at the
     same time, and let the second person resolve the conflict.
   * Applied a patch from Micha≈Ç to make the mercurial backend pass --quiet to
     hg.
   * Fix a security hole that allowed a web user to insert arbitrary html in
     the title of a page due to missing escaping of titles in the meta plugin."""]]
