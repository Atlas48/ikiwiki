News for ikiwiki 2.14:

   This version of ikiwiki is more picky about symlinks in the path leading
   to the srcdir, and will refuse to use a srcdir specified by such a path.
   This  was necessary to avoid some potential exploits, but could potentially
   break (semi-)working wikis. If your wiki has a srcdir path containing a
   symlink, you should change it to use a path that does not.

   * Let CC be used to control what compiler is used to build wrappers.
   * Use 'cc' instead of gcc as the default compiler.
   * Security fix: Ensure that there are no symlinks anywhere in the path
     to the top of the srcdir. In certian unusual configurations, an attacker
     who could commit to one of the parent directories of the srcdir could
     use a symlink attack to cause ikiwiki to publish files elsewhere in the
     filesystem. More details [[here|security#index29h2]]
