ikiwiki 1.12 released with these changes:

   "Viva l'Italia!"
   * New pagestats plugin from Enrico, which can generate a table counting
     the backlinks for each page, or a del.icio.us style cloud.
   * Build-depend on libtext-wikiformat-perl, so that the syntax check of
     the wikiformat plugin works. Thanks, Emanuele Aina.
   * Patch from Alessandro Dotti Contra to clean up backlinks and navbar
     display, running them through pagetitle. This removes ugly underscores and
     other gunk from the display, much nicer. You may want to rebuild your wiki
     when upgrading to get the cleanup globally.
   * Polygen plugin from Enrico.
   * htmltidy plugin from Faidon.
   * Locale patch from Faidon:
     - Adds a locale setting to setup files.
     - Proper local time, if the locale configuration option is used.
     - Support for UTF-8 (or ISO-8859-X) filenames in SVN. Before this patch,
       commiting (or even rcs\_updating) on repositories with UTF-8 filenames was
       impossible.
   * Add getopt hook type, this allows plugins to add new command-line options.
   * Add --tagbase option to tag plugin.
   * Add exclude option in setup files, works same as --exclude.
   * Put categories in rss feeds for tagged items.
   * Allow preprocessor directives to be expanded in inlined blog pages.
     However, to avoid inlining loops etc, don't expand inline directives in
     inlined pages.
   * fortune plugin (trivial)
   * Tag plugins according to type.
