ikiwiki 1.17 released with these changes:

   * Disable tidy generator tag.
   * Move tidy back to sanitize hook, found out how to only show body.
   * Turn off tidy indentation too.
   * Turn on HTML::Template loop\_context\_vars; not actually used in stock
     templates but can be useful for things like making comma-delimited lists
     of tags or what have you.
   * Remove &lt;br&gt; from end of aggregate preprocessor directive output.
   * Ship ikiwiki executable as ikiwiki.pl in source to avoid issues on
     case-sensative filesystems like OSX.
   * Improve markdown loading. First, try to load it as a proper perl module,
     in case it was installed as one. Then fall back to trying
     /usr/bin/markdown.
   * Document in install page how to install markdown, since it has no
     installation procedure in the upstream tarball.
   * Set die\_on\_bad\_params =&gt; 0 for all templates, to allow users to modify
     them without annoyances.
   * Suck in the page content when generating an inline archive page, to work
     around the meta plugin's lack of caching of title metadata across runs.
