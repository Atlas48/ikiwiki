ikiwiki 3.20170110 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
 * [ Amitai Schleier ]
   * wrappers: Correctly escape quotes in git\_wrapper\_background\_command
 * [ Simon McVittie ]
   * git: use an explicit function parameter for the directory to work
     in. Previously, we used global state that was not restored correctly
     on catching exceptions, causing an unintended log message
     "cannot chdir to .../ikiwiki-temp-working: No such file or directory"
     with versions &gt;= 3.20161229 when an attempt to revert a change fails
     or is disallowed
   * git: don't run "git rev-list ... -- -- ..." which would select the
     wrong commits if a file named literally "--" is present in the
     repository
   * check\_canchange: log "bad file name whatever", not literal string
     "bad file name %s"
   * t/git-cgi.t: fix a race condition that made the test fail
     intermittently
   * t/git-cgi.t: be more careful to provide a syntactically valid
     author/committer name and email, hopefully fixing this test on
     ci.debian.net
   * templates, comments, passwordauth: use rel=nofollow microformat
     for dynamic URLs
   * templates: use rel=nofollow microformat for comment authors
   * news: use Debian security tracker instead of MITRE for security
     references. Thanks, anarcat
   * Set package format to 3.0 (native)
   * d/copyright: re-order to put more specific stanzas later, to get the
     intended interpretation
   * d/source/lintian-overrides: override obsolete-url-in-packaging for
     OpenID Selector, which does not seem to have any more current URL
     (and in any case our version is a fork)
   * docwiki.setup: exclude TourBusStop from offline documentation.
     It does not make much sense there.
   * d/ikiwiki.lintian-overrides: override script-not-executable warnings
   * d/ikiwiki.lintian-overrides: silence false positive spelling warning
     for Moin Moin
   * d/ikiwiki.doc-base: register the documentation with doc-base
   * d/control: set libmagickcore-6.q16-3-extra as preferred
     build-dependency, with virtual package libmagickcore-extra as an
     alternative, to help autopkgtest to do the right thing"""]]
