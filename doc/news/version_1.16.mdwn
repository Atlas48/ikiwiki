ikiwiki 1.16 released with these changes:

   * Try to handle relative links in aggregated feeds. However,
     the current support is a crude hack due to limitations of XML::Feed:
     xml:base is not supported, neither is Content-Location. And of course,
     relative links in RSS feeds are ill-undefined..
   * Make aggregator save permalinks and author name to pages as metadata.
   * Add permalink and author support to meta plugin, affecting RSS feeds
     and blog pages.
   * Various CSS and formatting changes.
   * Encode link and guid urls in rss feeds to avoid illegal utf8 slipping in.
   * Add xhtml files to the default prune regexp.
   * Also generate rel=bookmark links for permalinks.
   * Fix the htmltidy plugin, which wasn't working due my breaking it when
     I added it..
   * Don't run tidy with -xml as that fails if the input is not well-formed.
     Run it with -asxhtml instead, so it will output well-formed xhtml no
     matter what the input.
   * Disable tidy warnings too.
   * Add a new format hook, and make tidy use it, since tidy can really only
     operate on and output complete html documents, not the body chunks
     that sanitise gets.
   * Fix dates in rss feeds if running localised, so they're still rfc 822.
