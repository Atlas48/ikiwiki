News for ikiwiki 2.49:

   The search plugin no longer uses hyperestrair. Instead, to use it you
   will now need to install xapian-omega, and the Search::Xapian,
   HTML::Scrubber, and Digest::SHA1 perl modules.

ikiwiki 2.49 released with [[toggle text="these changes"]]
[[toggleable text="""
   * haiku: Generate valid xhtml.
   * ikiwiki-mass-rebuild: Don't trust $! when setting $)
   * inline: The optimisation in 2.41 broke nested inlines. Detect those
     and avoid overoptimising.
   * search: Converted to use xapian-omega.
   * Filter hooks are no longer called during the scan phase. This will
     prevent wikilinks added by filters from being scanned properly. But
     no known filter hook does that, so let's not waste time on it.
   * Pass a destpage parameter to the sanitize hook.
   * The search interface now allows searching for a page by title
     ("title:foo"), as well as for pages that contain a given link
     ("link:bar")."""]]
