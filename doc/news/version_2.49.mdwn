News for ikiwiki 2.49:

   The search plugin no longer uses hyperestrair. Instead, to use it you
   will now need to install xapian-omega, and the [[cpan Search::Xapian]],
   [[cpan HTML::Scrubber]], and [[cpan Digest::SHA1]] perl modules. Ie,
   `apt-get install xapian-omega libsearch-xapian-perl libhtml-scrubber-perl libdigest-sha1-perl`

   Also, wikis that use the search plugin will need to be rebuilt, 
   since the search form has changed. This will not be done automatically,
   but can be done by running `ikiwiki-mass-upgrade` as root, or
   running `ikiwiki -setup` on individual setup files.

ikiwiki 2.49 released with [[toggle text="these changes"]]
[[toggleable text="""
   * haiku: Generate valid xhtml.
   * ikiwiki-mass-rebuild: Don't trust $! when setting $)
   * inline: The optimisation in 2.41 broke nested inlines. Detect those
     and avoid overoptimising.
   * search: Converted to use xapian-omega.
   * Filter hooks are no longer called during the scan phase. This will
     prevent wikilinks added by filters from being scanned properly. But
     no known filter hook does that, so let's not waste time on it.
   * Pass a destpage parameter to the sanitize hook.
   * The search interface now allows searching for a page by title
     ("title:foo"), as well as for pages that contain a given link
     ("link:bar")."""]]
