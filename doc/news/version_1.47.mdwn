News for ikiwiki 1.47:

   Due to a security fix, wikis that have the htmlscrubber enabled can no
   longer use the meta plugin to insert html link and meta tags.
   Some special case methods have been added for safely including stylesheets,
   and for doing openid delegation. See the meta plugin docs for details.

   * Fix a security hole that allowed insertion of unsafe content via the meta
     plugins's support for inserting html link and meta tags. Now such content
     is passed through the htmlscrubber like everything else.
   * Unfortunatly, that means that some valid uses of those tags are no longer
     usable, and special case methods needed to be added for including
     stylesheets, and for doing openid delegation. If you use either of these
     in your wiki, it will need to be modified. See the meta plugin docs
     for details."""]]
