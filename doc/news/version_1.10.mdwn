ikiwiki 1.10 released with these changes:

   * Run page through any relevant filters when generating a page preview.
   * Noticed a bug in the wikitext markup plugin -- it made CamelCase links the
     default throughout the wiki, not only on wikitext pages. Decided to call
     this a feature, and split the camelcase support out into a separate plugin
     that is independant of wikitext.
   * Fix CamelCase regexp to not break [[FooBar|BazBar]] WikiLinks.
