ikiwiki 1.13 released with these changes:

   * ikiwiki can now download and aggregate feeds with its new aggregate
     plugin, so it's possible to implement a Planet using ikiwiki!
   * Add a run\_hooks function for the common task of running all hooks of a
     given type.
   * Add a savestate hook.
   * Don't put blog post forms on pages if there's no cgiurl set.
   * --setup --refresh no longer rebuilds wrappers. Use --setup --refresh
     --wrappers to do that.
   * Add %IkiWiki::forcerebuild to provide a way for plugins like aggregate
     to update pages that haven't changed on disk.
   * Change meta tags to use html entity-escaped text for values, so that
     quotes and such can be represented in title tags.
   * Depend and build-depend on HTML::Parser for HTML::Entities which is used
     for the above.
   * Make --rebuild also cause --aggregate to re-download and write aggregated
     pages.
   * Avoid outputting duplicate meta info.
   * Include title metadata on aggregated posts for capitalised and un-munged
     titles.
   * Title metadata of inlined pages now shows up in blogs and rss feeds.
   * Fix issue with unicode filenames and updating the hyper estradier search
     index. (Aka Please Please Please, let that be the last one.)
   * Patch from Roland Mas to support an rss=no parameter to inline directives.
     Closes: #[380743](http://bugs.debian.org/380743)
   * Renamed GlobLists to PageSpecs.
   * PageSpecs can now include nested parens, "and", and "or". This remains
     backwards compatible to the old GlobList format. It's implemented by
     treating the GlobList as a very limited microlanguage that is transformed
     to perl code that does the matching.
   * The old GlobList format is deprecated, and I encourage users to switch to
     using the new PageSpec format. Compatability with the old format will be
     removed at some point, possibly by 2.0.
   * Wiki rebuild needed on upgrade to this version due to PageSpec change.
   * Add support for creation\_month and creation\_year to PageSpec.
     Closes: #[380680](http://bugs.debian.org/380680)
   * Changes to index file encoding.
