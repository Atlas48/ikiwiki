ikiwiki 2.67 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * remove: Avoid $\_ breakage. (Stupid, stupid perl.)
   * Updated Spanish translation from Victor Moral.
   * lockedit: Support specifying which users (and IP addresses) a page
     is locked for. This supports most of the ACL type things users have been
     wanting to be done. Closes: #[443346](http://bugs.debian.org/443346) (It does not control who can read a
     page, but that's out of scope for ikiwiki.)
   * orphans: Fix unquoted page name in regexp.
   * google: Plugin provides google site search, contributed by Peter Simons.
   * Pass HTTPS variable through the wrapper so that CGI-&gt;https can be used
     by plugins. Closes: #[502047](http://bugs.debian.org/502047)
   * inline: Allow MTIME to be used in inlinepage.tmpl.
   * inline: Use the feed's description in the rss and atom links.
     Closes: #[502113](http://bugs.debian.org/502113)
   * aggregate: Avoid bug that caused immediate expiration of items
     with a date in the future."""]]
