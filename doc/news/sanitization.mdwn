ikiwiki's main outstanding security hole, lack of [[HtmlSanitization]] has
now been addressed. ikiwiki now sanitizes html by default.

If only trusted parties can edit your wiki's content, then you might want
to turn this sanitization back off to allow use of potentially dangerous
tags. To do so, pass --no-sanitize or set "sanitize =&gt; 0," in your
[[ikiwiki.setup]].
