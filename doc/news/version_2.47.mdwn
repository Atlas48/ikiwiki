ikiwiki 2.47 released with [[toggle text="these changes"]]
[[toggleable text="""
   * mdwn: Add a multimarkdown setup file option.
   * If PERL5LIB is set to the libdir when building ikiwiki, calculate and
     hardcode a proper 'use lib' statement anyway. This fixes a gotcha,
     since PERL5LIB won't work once ikiwiki is running via a wrapper or as
     a cgi.
   * orphans: As a special case, the toplevel index page is never considered
     an orphaned page.
   * inline: Display a message if the 'pages' parameter is missing, before
     it just expanded to nothing.
   * git: Skip over signed-off-by and similar lines in commit messages
     when generating recentchanges.
   * ENV can be used in the setup file to override environment variable
     settings, such as TZ or PATH.
   * Perls older than 5.10 need to use the old method of decoding utf-8 in CGI
     values. Neither method will work for all versions of perl, so check
     version number at runtime.
   * Avoid unsightly warning message when evaling broken pagespecs.
   * Improve error message when a pagespec fails to parse."""]]
