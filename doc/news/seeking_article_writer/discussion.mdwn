As this is a wiki, could you set up a page where those of us
who might be able to contribute a little could work together
to write the article?

I realise that I could just start it myself, but if you wanted to
create a page somewhere and state in a few words how you would
like the article to go (maybe what to emphasise, or what angle
to work from), we could come up with something.

Do you know if they are just after an overview article, or an
actual guide to setting up an instance? --JamesWestby
