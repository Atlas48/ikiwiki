ikiwiki 1.33 released with these changes:

   * Fix issue with aggregate plugin updating expired pages.
   * Avoid syntax errors in templates used by the template plugin crashing
     ikiwiki.
   * Enable utf8 file IO in aggregate plugin.
   * Fix some issues with the new registration form.
   * Patch from Ethan Glasser Camp to add a skip option to the inline plugin.
   * Make sure to check for errors from every eval.
   * Fix img plugin's handling of adding dependencies for images that do not
     yet exist.
   * Work around a strange bug in CGI::FormBuilder 3.0401 that makes
     FORM-SUBMIT unusable on customised formbuilder templates. For now,
     hardcode the submit buttons in editpage.tmpl instead of using the
     template variable, which is ok, since the buttons are static.
   * Work with hyperestraier 1.4.9.
