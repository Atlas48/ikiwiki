ikiwiki 1.21 released with these changes:

   * Add a tail fin^W^Wsidebar plugin by Tuomo Valkonen.
   * If a page links to itself, mark up the link text in a span with
     class="selflink" so that it can be styled. I don't have a useful style
     defined for that though.
   * Call filter hooks on inlined page content.
   * Support inlining pages raw, rather than creating a blog.
   * Clean up yes/no parameter parsing in inline plugin.
   * Implemented better cycle detection in the inline plugin; nested inlines
     will now work.
   * Add a map plugin contributed by Alessandro Dotti Contra.
   * Add otl format plugin, which handles files as created by vimoutliner.
   * Fix ikiwiki-mass-rebuild to work in the way the postinst uses it.
   * Add first draft at a Restructured Text (rst) plugin, by Sergio
     Talens-Oliag. Note that this has many known issues -- see the caveats on
     the plugin's page.
   * Credit everyone who wrote a plugin on the plugins' wiki pages.
   * Fix utf-8 in blog post form.
