*TMPL_INCLUDE is no longer supported in any template used by ikiwiki. It used to be allowed in certian templates, but not in others.*

Would it be possible to make that a config option?  Because I do use includes in my templates, and I don't allow users to edit templates, so it isn't a security loophole for me. --[[KathrynAndersen]]
