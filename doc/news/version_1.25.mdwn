ikiwiki 1.25 released with these changes:

   * Add proper waitpid calls for open2ed processes throughout to avoid
     zombies; this hit htmltidy especially badly.
   * Drop real uid/gid in the suid wrapper, thus allowing commits to remote
     subversion repos and fixing some other issues.
   * Add support for tla, contributed by Clint Adams. Closes: #[385936](http://bugs.debian.org/385936)
   * Add support for mercurial, contributed by Emanuele Aina.
   * Include &lt;link rel&gt; tag for RSS feeds, used by some aggregators and
     firefox to find the feed.
   * Add a linkmap plugin (requires graphviz).
