Quick poll: Do you feel that ikiwiki is fast enough on this server, or
should I move it to my much beefier auxillary server?

[[poll 26 "It's fast enough" 3 "It's too slow!" 2 "No opinion"]]

If you have specifics on performance issues, you might mention them on the
[[discussion]] page.

The current server is a single processor 2.8 ghz Sepron machine shared
amoung 4 other xen instances, and often 
[heavily loaded](http://bluebird.kitenet.net/munin/kitenet.net/wren.kitenet.net-load.html)
by extraneous stuff like spamassassin and compiles. The auxillary server is
a dual processor, dual core 2 ghz Opteron shared with other xen instances
(exact number not available from provider), but with
[little other load](http://bluebird.kitenet.net/munin/kitenet.net/bluebird.kitenet.net-load.html).
