# Why Git?

I'm very curious about the main reasons of your leaving Subversion and moving
ikiwiki to Git. Are there only easier way to maintain and submit patches for
ikiwiki? It's very interesting for me, because I know you are long-time Subversion
user and very experienced with it.

I know that Git is very "modern" SCM these days, but I don't understand the hype
about it. This's not only one distributed SCM on the free/open source world.
Maybe that model of work is better for you, but then you can use also Darcs,
Mercurial, Bazaar or SVK :)
