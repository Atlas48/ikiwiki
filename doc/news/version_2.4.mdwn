ikiwiki 2.4 released with [[toggle text="these changes"]]
[[toggleable text="""
   * Make the toc plugin use html-compatible anchors. This is necessary since
     most web sites serve ikiwiki xhtml files as text/html and mozilla browsers
     get confused. So it's best for ikiwiki to follow the compatability
     recommendations in appendix C of the XHTML spec. Closes: #[432045](http://bugs.debian.org/432045)
   * Support building on systems that lack asprintf.
   * mercurial getctime is currently broken, apparently by some change in
     mercurial version 0.9.4. Turn the failing test case into a TODO test case.
   * Fix links to alternate stylesheets when usedirs is enabled. Closes: #[432556](http://bugs.debian.org/432556)
   * Use type= not style= in html for alternate stylesheets, which is more
     correct (but in my testing both epiphany and iceweasel work ok with
     style=text/css).
   * In img tag, allow link=no to disable link to full size image. Thanks,
     Nis Martensen. Closes: #[433188](http://bugs.debian.org/433188)"""]]
