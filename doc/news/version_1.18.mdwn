ikiwiki 1.18 released with these changes:

   * The last release accidentially installed ikiwiki as ikiwiki.pl, now fixed.
   * Add --version.
   * Man page format fixups.
   * If the meta plugin overides the page title, set a title\_overridden
     variable in the template to true. This allows doing things with the
     templates conditional on the title being overriden.
   * Add a %pagecase which maps lower-case page names to the actual case
     used in the filename. Use this in bestlinks calculation instead of
     forcing the link to lowercase.
   * Also use %pagecase in various other places that want to check if a page
     with a given name exists.
   * This means that links to pages with mixed case names will now work,
     even if the link is in some other case mixture, and mixed case pages
     should be fully supported throughout ikiwiki.
   * Recommend rebuilding wikis on upgrade to this version.
