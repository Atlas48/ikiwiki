ikiwiki 2.18 released with [[toggle text="these changes"]]
[[toggleable text="""
   * Split error messages for failures to drop real uid and gid.
   * Retry dropping uid and gid, possibly this will help with the "Resource
     temporarily unavailable" failures I've experienced under xen.
   * Stop testing Encode::is\_utf8 in decode\_form\_utf8: That doesn't work.
   * decode\_form\_utf8 only fixed the utf-8 encoding for fields that were
     registered at the time it was called, which was before the
     formbuilder\_setup hook. Fields added by the hook didn't get decoded.
     But it can't be put after the hook either, since plugins using the hook
     need to be able to use form values. To fix this dilemma, it's been changed
     to a decode\_cgi\_utf8, which is called on the cgi query object, before the
     form is set up, and decodes *all* cgi parameters.
   * aggregate: Only save state if it was already loaded. This didn't used to
     matter, but after recent changes, state is not always loaded, and saving
     would kill it.
   * table: Fix dependency tracking for external data files. Closes: #[458387](http://bugs.debian.org/458387)"""]]
