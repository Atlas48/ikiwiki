News for ikiwiki 2.52:

   All wikis need to be rebuilt on upgrade to this version. If you listed your
   wiki in /etc/ikiwiki/wikilist this will be done automatically when the
   Debian package is upgraded. Or use ikiwiki-mass-rebuild to force a rebuild.

ikiwiki 2.52 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * attachment: New plugin for uploading and managing attachments.
     This includes a fairly powerful PageSpec based admin pref for deciding
     whether to accept a given upload, and an attachment management interface
     on the edit page.
     (Sponsored by The TOVA Company.)
   * If attachments are not enabled, configure CGI.pm to disable file
     uploads by default. (An anti-DOS measure.)
   * toggle: Add support for toggles that are open by default.
   * toggle: Fix to work in preview mode.
   * toggle: Add javascript to top of page, not to end. This avoids flicker
     since closed toggles will not be displayed as the page is loading.
   * The editpage form now uses the raw page name, not the page title, in its
     'page' cgi parameter. Using the title was ambiguous and made it
     impossible to tell between some pages, like "foo/bar" and "foo\_\_47\_\_bar",
     sometimes causing the wrong page to be edited.
   * This change means that some edit links need to be updated.
     Force a rebuild on upgrade to this version.
   * Above change also allowed really fixing escaped slashes from the blogpost
     form."""]]
