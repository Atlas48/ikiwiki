I think that I have logged in using openid! But I think the login page
could use some adjustemnts.

Perhaps the openid stuff should be seperate, unless I was supposed to login
as well. Also have I just created an account on this wiki as well?

# How to ban an IP address?

There is a way to ban ikiwiki users, but how to ban an IP address?
For example if a bitchy anonymous is bombing our poll. I can use
only Apache/iptables rules for this? Maybe it's related to
[[ACL|todo/ACL]] request? --[[Paweł|ptecza]]

### Logging Out

If I've logged in by OpenID, how do I log out?  I don't see any logout button anywhere on IkiWIki.  (is it because I hit "forever" for my OpenID authorization duration?)
> No, it's because it's on the preferences page!  That's somewhat non-obvious...

Even if IkiWiki does let me log out, how do I *stay* logged out?  Let's say I'm using a kiosk.  What's to prevent someone else from hitting my OpenID service right after I've walked away?  My OpenID service will just auth the login again, won't it? --[[sabr]]   (behavior seems to vary...  does it depend on the OpenID service?  guess I have some docs to read.)
