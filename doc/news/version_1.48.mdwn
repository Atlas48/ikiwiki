ikiwiki 1.48 released with [[toggle text="these changes"]]
[[toggleable text="""
   * Fix link() PageSpecs to not just look at the raw link text, but at where
     that given link points based on the page doing the linking. Note that this
     could make such PageSpecs match different things than before, if you
     relied on the old behavior of them only matching the raw link text.
   * This required changing the match\_* interface, adding a third parameter.
   * Allow link() PageSpecs to match relative, as is allowed with globs.
   * Add postform option to inline plugin.
   * Add an bug tracker to the softwaresite example.
   * Make ikiwiki's stylesheet support printing by hiding parts of the page
     that shouldn't appear in a printout: Search box, actions bar,
     blog post form, tags, backlinks, and feed buttons.
   * Finally fixed the longstanding inline removal bug.
   * Renamed %oldpagemtime to a more accurately named %pagemtime and fix it to
     actually store pages' mtimes.
   * Add "mtime" sort parameter to inline plugin.
   * Fix mercurial backend to deal with empty commit messages."""]]
