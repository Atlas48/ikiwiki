ikiwiki 2.11 released with [[toggle text="these changes"]]
[[toggleable text="""
   * Correct a pair of logic errors that triggered if svnpath was empty.
   * If gitorigin\_branch is set to the empty string, don't push or pull.
     Useful for laptop clones of remote wikis.
   * Add a calendar plugin, contributed by Manoj Srivastava.
   * Reformat calendar plugin to ikiwiki conventions.
   * The calendar plugin made *every* page depend on every other page,
     which seemed a wee tiny little bit overkill. Fixed the dependency
     calculations (I hope.)
   * Removed manual ctime statting code, and just have the calendar plugin use
     %pagectime.
   * Ikiwiki has moved into a git repository.
   * postsparkline: Avoid a confusing error message if no pages match
     and instead show an empty graph.
   * Add handling of feeds for nested inlines, as well as support for a
     single page containing two different feeds.
   * Also fixed some places in inline that failed to use destpage correctly.
   * ikiwiki-mass-rebuild: Patch from HenrikBrixAndersen to fix order
     of permissions dropping code to work on FreeBSD.
   * ikiwiki-mass-rebuild: Don't clear PATH from the environment.
   * Run git-commit -q (though it doesn't do much good due to its stderr
     abuse)."""]]
