ikiwiki 1.41 released with [[toggle text="these changes"]]
[[toggleable text="""
   * Gettext 1.04 or up is needed for the OO interface that ikiwiki needs,
     if an older version is installed, just don't gettext strings, instead of
     crashing.
   * Added smileys for Moin Moin compatability.
   * Fix handling of discussion links on discussion pages when l10n is used.
   * Make gitorigin\_branch and gitmaster\_branch configurable via the setup
     file. Closes: #[408599](http://bugs.debian.org/408599)
   * French translation update. Closes: #[408593](http://bugs.debian.org/408593)
   * Improve use of svn merge, by specifying the file to merge, rather than
     chdiring to the srcdir (which wasn't right when merging in a subdir).
     Thanks Ethan.
   * Always call rcs\_update after a commit during a web edit, to work around
     the problem described in bugs/svn\_fails\_to\_update. Thanks to Ethan for the
     analysis and patch.
   * Replace underscores in shortcut texts with spaces when formatting for
     display. This allows using a shortcut like [[wikipedia War\_of\_1812]],
     which links to the correct remote page, but is displayed nicely.
   * When building the doc wiki, build with LANG=C.
   * More gettext fun.
   * Fix openid signin secret generation code. This fixes the bug that made
     all openid signins fail the first time, and then succeed the second
     time."""]]
