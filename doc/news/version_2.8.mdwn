ikiwiki 2.8 released with [[toggle text="these changes"]]
[[toggleable text="""
   * Redid the debian/copyright file, using the proposed new copyright file
     format. Included many details not previously listed in the old file.
   * inline: add feedonly option, set feedonly=yes to get only the feed button
     but not inline the pages.
   * meta: Support license and copyright information. The information will
     be shown in the page footer. HTML will also be inserted that should
     support the rel=license microformat as well as the HTML spec's
     rel=copyright.
   * table plugin: Actually specify the delimiter when parsing CSV.
   * table plugin: The previous version broke WikiLinks inside quoted values.
     Fix this by linkifying CSV data after parsing it, while DSV data is still
     linkified before parsing."""]]
