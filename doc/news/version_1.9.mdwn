ikiwiki 1.9 released with these changes:

   * Improve display of parentlinks and page title of toplevel index page.
   * Patch from Faidon to use svn --limit when possible for recentchanges,
     speeds up recentchanges a lot for wikis with more history.
   * Patch from Recai to fix utf8 issues in git backend.
   * Add wikitext markup plugin, which supports ".wiki" pages written in the
     original wiki syntax, CamelCase links and all.
   * Support a w3mmode, which lets w3m run ikiwiki using its local CGI
     support, to edit pages etc without a web server.
   * Display CGI processing errors if present.
   * Fix from Faidon for a XML parser issue that breaks utf-8 for
     RecentChanges. Avoid using XML::SAX::PurePerl, which is buggy in this
     area, and also way slow.
   * Match 'web commit from' in SVN and git, these are web commits too.
     (Faidon)
   * Consolidated all decode\_utf8 in FormBuilder's fields to make the code more
     readable and avoid future mistakes. The patch seems to work and for the
     first time I have a UTF-8 username ;-) (Faidon)
   * Use form-&gt;field consistently, not form-&gt;param.
   * Patch from Recai to allow selection of page type when creating a new page.
     Default page type is inherited from the link clicked on to create the new
     page.
