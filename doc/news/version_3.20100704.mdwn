     a username taken from openid.

     openid provider.
   * git: Record the nickname from openid in the git author email.
   * comment: Record the username from openid in the comment page.
   * Fixed some confusion and bugginess about whether
     rcs\_getctime/rcs\_getmtime were passed absolute or relative filenames.
     (Make it relative like everything else.)
   * hnb: Fixed broken use of mkstemp that had caused dangling temp files,
     and prevented actually rendering hnb files.
   * Use comment template on comments page of example blog.

     page. (Such as a discussion page.)

     runs.
