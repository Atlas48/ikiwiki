 * [ Joey Hess ]
   * inline: Prevent creating a file named ".mdwn" when the
     postform is submitted with an empty title.
 * [ Simon McVittie ]
   * Security: tell `git revert` not to follow renames. If it does, then
     renaming a file can result in a revert writing outside the wiki srcdir
     or altering a file that the reverting user should not be able to alter,
     an authorization bypass. Thanks, intrigeri
   * cgitemplate: remove some dead code. Thanks, blipvert
   * Restrict CSS matches against header class to not break
     Pandoc tables with header rows. Thanks, karsk
   * Make pagestats output more deterministic. Thanks, intrigeri"""]]
