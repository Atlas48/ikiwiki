News for ikiwiki 2.46:

   There were some significant template changes in ikiwiki 2.42 (and 1.33.5).
   If you have locally modified versions of the templates, they need to be
   updated. Most notably, the editpage.tmpl has a new FIELD-SID added to it,
   without which web editing will fail.

ikiwiki 2.46 released with [[toggle text="these changes"]]
[[toggleable text="""
   * amazon\_s3: New plugin, which injects wiki pages into Amazon S3, allowing
     ikiwiki to be used without a dedicated web server.
   * aggregate: Add support for web-based triggering of aggregation
     for people stuck on shared hosting without cron. (Sheesh.) Enabled
     via the `aggregate\_webtrigger` configuration optiom.
   * Add pinger and pingee plugins, which allow setting up mirrors and branched
     wikis that automatically ping one another to stay up to date.
   * Optimised file statting code when scanning for modified pages;
     cut the number of system calls in half. (Still room for improvement.)
   * Fixes for behavior changes in perl 5.10's CGI that broke utf-8 support
     in several interesting ways."""]]
