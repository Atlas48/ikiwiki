ikiwiki 2.5 released with [[toggle text="these changes"]]
[[toggleable text="""
   * Wrap the editpage template in the standard misctemplate, this allows the
     pagetemplate hook to work for that page.
   * Above change fixes the favicon plugin to work on edit pages.
   * Correct some issues with escaped preprocessor directives.
   * Make the map plugin notice when pages in the map are deleted and update
     it.
   * Add a htmlext config option, this can be used to make ikiwiki generate
     html files with a different extension.
   * Fix graphviz plugin to not try to read images as utf-8; they might
     sometimes contain invalid utf-8 byte sequences. Thanks,
     HenrikBrixAndersen.
   * Fix re-rendering of pages when a linked to page goes away. This was broken
     in version 1.50 with the addition of %destsources. Thanks, Ethan
     Glasser-Camp.
   * Add templatefile hook.
   * Add pagetemplate plugin, which allows changing the template used for
     a page. (Not to be confused with the hook of the same name..)
   * Add a libdir config option to let ikiwiki load perl modules, including
     plugins, from a user-configurable directory."""]]
