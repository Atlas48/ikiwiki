Don Marti asked me if I'd like to write an article about ikiwiki for
LinuxWorld.com, but I don't have such an article in me right now, and
thought I'd see if someone else is interested in writing it. Here's Don's
request:

> I'd be interested in getting a
> tutorial article on ikiwiki.  Would you be interested
> in writing one, or do you know someone who is?
> We have an Artistic Immortality Clause, so you would
> keep the copyright and could use anything you write as
> part of the project docs.  I'm especially interested
> in the lightweight workflow aspects, such as using
> a wiki as a bug tracking system.
