News for ikiwiki 1.42:

   The anonok setting in config files has been removed. To enable
   httpauth support on your wiki, you should now enable the anonok plugin,
   instead.
   Third-party plugins that use pagespec\_match() should be updated to pass
   the new third parameter (from) to that function. This is needed for the
   new relative glob matching to work.

   * Fix several more missing translations of Discussion.
   * Fix for missing backlinks() in pagestats plugin.
   * Add canedit hook, allowing arbitrary controls over when a page can be
     edited.
   * Move code forcing signing before edit to a new "signinedit" plugin, and
     code checking for locked pages into a new "lockedit" plugin. Both are
     enabled by default.
   * Remove the anonok config setting. This is now implemented by a new
     "anonok" plugin. Anyone with a wiki allowing anonymous edits should
     change their configs to enable this new plugin.
   * Add an opendiscussion plugin that allows anonymous users to edit
     discussion pages, on a wiki that otherwise wouldn't allow it.
   * Lots of CGI code reorg and cleanup.
   * Avoid using lots of memory when copying large non-html files.
     Yes, you can keep videos in the wiki..
   * Add feedshow option to allow reducing the number of items included in
     an rss or atom feed.
   * Change based on a patch from Ethan to support relative matching in
     PageSpecs, by using "./".
   * pagespec\_match() has grown a new third parameter to support this.
   * Add "reverse" option to inline to invert sort orders.
   * Drop the BSD license for the templates and basewiki, and just allow them
     to be used as close to public domain as possible.
   * viewcvs is now viewvc (in Debian unstable), update everything to use the
     new name.
   * Fix a security hole that allowed a web user to edit images and other
     non-page format files in the wiki. To exploit this, the file already had
     to exist in the wiki, and the web user would need to somehow use the web
     based editor to replace it with malicious content.
     (Sorry Josh, this means you can't edit style.css directly anymore,
     although I do appreciate your fixes, actually..)"""]]
