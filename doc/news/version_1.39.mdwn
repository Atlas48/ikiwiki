   * Add a rawhtml plugin that allows copying raw html files from the srcdir.
   * Fix --locale to control LC\_ALL now.
   * Include the pot file in the source tarball. Closes: #[405890](http://bugs.debian.org/405890)
   * Add a Swedish translation by Daniel Nylander. Closes: #[406410](http://bugs.debian.org/406410)
   * Add a Czech translation by Miroslav Kure.
   * Add a Bulgarian translation by Damyan Ivanov. Closes: #[406580](http://bugs.debian.org/406580)
   * Add a Gujarati translation by Kartik Mistry. Closes: #[406635](http://bugs.debian.org/406635)
   * Add a Vietnamese translation by Clytie Siddall.
   * Fix encoding issue with use of Locale::Gettext. Seems that the OO
     interface returns proper utf-8 decoded strings, unlike the traditional
     interface, so use the OO interface.
   * Search in default location for templates as a fallback when templatedir is
     pointed elsewhere, so that only modified templates need to be copied into
     a templatedir. Based on work by JeremyReed.
   * In the aggregator, check for and deal with post filenames that are
     longer than the maximum file length.
   * Change the RecentChanges page to show the path of changed pages.
   * Various minor bugfixes."""]]
