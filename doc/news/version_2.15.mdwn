ikiwiki 2.15 released with [[toggle text="these changes"]]
[[toggleable text="""
   * Add a new ikiwiki-makerepo program, that automates setting up a repo
     and importing existing content for svn, git, and mercurial. This makes
     the setup process much simpler.
   * Reorganised git documentation.
   * Actually install the ikiwiki-update-wikilist program.
   * Improve workaround for perl bug #376329. Rather than double-encoding,
     which has been reported to cause encoding problems (though I haven't
     reproduced them), just catch a failure of markdown, and retry.
     (The crazy perl bug magically disappears on the retry.)
     Closes: #[449379](http://bugs.debian.org/449379)
   * Add umask configuration option. Closes: #[443329](http://bugs.debian.org/443329)"""]]
