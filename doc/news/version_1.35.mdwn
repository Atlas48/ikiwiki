ikiwiki 1.35 released with [[toggle text="these changes"]]
[[toggleable text="""
   * Fix daemonisation code to only do daemon setup things after forking the
     child process.
   * The hack used to make the pagetemplate hook have access to the editpage
     template won't work with CGI::FormBuilder 3.0401, so disable it for now.
   * CGI::FormBuilder 3.0401 seems to work ok now with ikiwiki, although
     there might still be bugs lurking.."""]]
