So you want to set up your own wiki using ikiwiki? This turorial will walk
you through setting up a wiki that is stored in [[Subversion]] and that has
optional support for commits from the web.

1. [[Install]] ikiwiki.

		apt-get install ikiwiki # soon

   Ikiwiki requires [[MarkDown]] be installed, and also uses the following
   perl modules: `CGI::Session` `CGI::FormBuilder` (version 3.02.02 or
   newer) `HTML::Template` `Mail::SendMail` `Time::Duration` `Date::Parse`
   (libtimedate-perl), `HTML::Scrubber`

2. Create the subversion repository for your wiki.

		svnadmin create /svn/wikirepo
		svn mkdir file:///svn/wikirepo/trunk -m create

3. Check out the repository to make the working copy that ikiwiki will use.

		svn co file:///svn/wikirepo/trunk ~/wikiwc

4. Build your wiki for the first time.

		ikiwiki --verbose ~/wikiwc/ ~/public_html/wiki/ \
			--url=http://host/~you/wiki/

   Replace the url with the real url to your wiki. You should now
   be able to visit the url and see your wiki.

5. Customise your wiki. The files in `/usr/share/ikiwiki/basewiki/` are
   used if you don't have a custom version, so let's start by making a
   custom version of the wiki's index page:

   		cp /usr/share/ikiwiki/basewiki/index.mdwn ~/wikiwc
		svn add ~/wikiwc/index.mdwn
		$EDITOR ~/wikiwc/index.mdwn
		svn commit ~/wikiwc/index.mdwn -m customised

   You can also add any files you like from scratch of course.

6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 as desired, editing or adding pages and rebuilding
   the wiki. You can play around with other ikiwiki parameters such as
   `--wikiname` and `--rebuild` too. Get comfortable with its command line
   (see [[usage]]).

7. By now you should be getting tired of typing in all the command line
   options each time you change something in your wiki's setup. And it's
   also getting old to have to manualy rebuild the wiki each time you
   change a file. Time to introduce setup files. 
   
   A sample setup file is [[ikiwiki.setup]]. Download it (or copy it from
   `doc/ikiwiki.setup` in the ikiwiki sources), and edit it. 
   
   Most of the options, like `wikiname` in the setup file are the same as
   ikiwiki's command line options (documented in [[usage]]. `srcdir`
   and `destdir` are the two directories you specify when
   running ikiwiki by hand. `svnrepo` is the path to your subversion 
   repository. Make sure that all of these are pointing to the right
   directories, and read through and configure the rest of the file to your
   liking.

   Note that the default file has a block to configure a svn wrapper. This
   sets up a [[post-commit]] hook to update the wiki.

   When you're satisfied, run `ikiwiki --setup ikiwiki.setup`, and it
   will set everything up and update your wiki.

8. Set up [[CGI]] to allow editing the wiki from the web.

   Just edit ikiwiki.setup, uncomment the block for the cgi wrapper, make
   sure the filename for the cgi wrapper is ok, run 
   `ikiwiki --setup ikiwiki.setup`, and you're done!

9. Add [[PageHistory]] links to the top of pages. This requires you to have
   setup [[ViewCVS]] or something similar to access your [[Subversion]]
   repository.  The `historyurl` setting makes ikiwiki add the links, and 
   in that url, "\[[file]]" is replaced with the name of the file to view. So
   edit ikiwiki.setup and set `historyurl` to something like this:

   	`http://svn.host/trunk/\[[file]]?root=wiki`
   
   Then run `ikiwiki --setup ikiwiki.setup` again.

10. Enjoy your new wiki! Add yourself to [[IkiWikiUsers]]
