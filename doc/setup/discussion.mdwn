Can the instructions for using `ikiwiki-makerepo` be clarified. This
command wants to create folders in the directory it is run in. Which
directory should that be - `$SRCDIR?` --Andy

Sorry, was not precise enough. It does if you are using the git option. I
believe this is partially explained on the rcs/git/ page. However I'm still
not totally clear where I should run the command when using git. If I
should be in $SRCDIR then updating the instructions to something like

    REPOSITORY=~/wiki.git
    cd $SRCDIR
    ikiwiki-makerepo git $SCDIR $REPOSITORY

might clear things up a little. Apologies if I'm being a bit dim, learning
ikiwiki and git at same time :) 

Have tried 3 options

1. mkdir $REP cd $REP run command (says $REP already exists so won't run)
2. rm -rf $REP cd $SRC run command (creates a repository in $SRC, does not create $REP ends with "remote origin already exists"
3. mkdir $TMP cd $TMP run command (creates a repository in $SRC/.git creates a repository in $TMP, does nothing to $REP, ends with "remote origin already exists".

Version of ikiwiki installed is package from Ubuntu/Hardy 2.19
Git version is 1.5.2.5

n.b. svn version of command worked fine :)

Looks like your git does not support GIT_DIR being used with git-init. I
see some mentions of changes in git's changelog for 1.5.3 that look
relevant. I've changed ikiwiki-makerepo to use a method more portable to
older versions of git. --[[Joey]]

Many thanks Joey, upgraded my git, and now have working iki :) -- Andy

It isn't intended that .ikiwiki be versioned, is it? Do you have a svn:ignore set? 
Is there some magic way you can make the svn commands (and presumably commands for 
the other VCSs here) ignore the .ikiwiki directory during step 8, when they import it?
If not, maybe a note should be made that the user should delete this file before 
they import. --Ethan

These instructions should probably show how to use a bare Git repository
(`GIT_DIR=somewhere.git git-init-db`) rather than a repository with a full
working copy. You can always clone the repository if you want your own local
working copy. Furthermore, this allows you to make multiple commits to your
working copy before pushing them to the repository and causing the wiki to
update. --[[JoshTriplett]]

Furthermore the git instructions should be changed to move the *.ikiwiki*
directory back into the wiki's working copy directory, isn't it? --[[tschwinge]]

Curious as to why support for CVS is not built in. --[[Luther]]

What is the syntax for specifying the adminuser as an openid user?  I've tried a couple things but I'm missing something.   Thanks for any pointers.  -- [[AdamShand]]
