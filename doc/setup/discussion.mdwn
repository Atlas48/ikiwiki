Can the instructions for using `ikiwiki-makerepo` be clarified. This
command wants to create folders in the directory it is run in. Which
directory should that be - `$SRCDIR?` --Andy

Sorry, was not precise enough. It does if you are using the git option. I believe this is partially explained on the rcs/git/ page. However I'm still not totally clear where I should run the command when using git. If I should be in $SRCDIR then updating the instructions to something like

    REPOSITORY=~/wiki.git
    cd $SRCDIR
    ikiwiki-makerepo git $SRCDIR $REPOSITORY

might clear things up a little. Apologies if I'm being a bit dim, learning ikiwiki and git at same time :) --Andy

It isn't intended that .ikiwiki be versioned, is it? Do you have a svn:ignore set? 
Is there some magic way you can make the svn commands (and presumably commands for 
the other VCSs here) ignore the .ikiwiki directory during step 8, when they import it?
If not, maybe a note should be made that the user should delete this file before 
they import. --Ethan

These instructions should probably show how to use a bare Git repository
(`GIT_DIR=somewhere.git git-init-db`) rather than a repository with a full
working copy. You can always clone the repository if you want your own local
working copy. Furthermore, this allows you to make multiple commits to your
working copy before pushing them to the repository and causing the wiki to
update. --[[JoshTriplett]]

Furthermore the git instructions should be changed to move the *.ikiwiki*
directory back into the wiki's working copy directory, isn't it? --[[tschwinge]]

Curious as to why support for CVS is not built in. --[[Luther]]
