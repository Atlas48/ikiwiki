It isn't intended that .ikiwiki be versioned, is it? Do you have a svn:ignore set? 
Is there some magic way you can make the svn commands (and presumably commands for 
the other VCSs here) ignore the .ikiwiki directory during step 8, when they import it?
If not, maybe a note should be made that the user should delete this file before 
they import. --Ethan
