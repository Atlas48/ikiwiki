What directory is the 'working copy'? There can be two interpretations: the current dir and the .git dir.

The page says *"Note that this file should **not** be put in your wiki's directory with the rest of the files."* Why is that?

One possible thing is security: Is it just a precaution or would anyone with "write" access to wiki be able to replace the file?
