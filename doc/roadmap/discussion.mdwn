Changing pagespecs to be relative by default is quite feasible now, but it will cause
backwards compatibility problems. Should this be marked as a future plan, perhaps at a 
major version number like 2.0? --Ethan

Yes, I'm looking at making this kind of change at 2.0, added to the list.
However, I have doubts that it makes good sense to go relative by default.
While it's not consitent with links, it seems to work better overall to
have pagespecs be absolute by default, IMHO. --[[Joey]]
