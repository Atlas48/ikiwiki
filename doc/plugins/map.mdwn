This plugin generates a hierarchical page map for the wiki. Example usage:

	\[[map pages="* and !blog/* and !*/Discussion"]]

If the pages to include are not specified, all pages (and other files) in
the wiki are mapped.

Hint: To limit the map to displaying pages less than a certian level deep,
use a [[PageSpec]] like this: `pages="* and !*/*/*"`

This plugin is included in ikiwiki, but is not enabled by default.

If this plugin is enabled, here is a page map for the plugins section
of this wiki:

[[map pages="(plugins or plugins/*) and !*/*/*"]]

[[tag type/meta]]
