This plugin generates a hierarchical page map for the wiki. Example usage:

	\[[map pages="* and !blog/*" maxdepth=2]]

If the pages to include are not specified, all pages (and other files) in
the wiki are mapped. If the maxdepth parameter is passed, only pages nested
less than that many levels deep will be included in the map.

This plugin is included in ikiwiki, but is not enabled by default.

If this plugin is enabled, here is a page map for the plugins section
of this wiki:

[[map pages="plugins or plugins/*" maxdepth=3]]

[[tag type/meta]]
