# How can I enable textile?

What I did:

1. Install textile.pm in $HOME/bin and added this directory to @INC in ikiwiki.

1. wrote <pre>add_plugins => [qw{textile}],</pre> into .ikiwiki/ikiwiki.setup

1. wrote a short test.txtl in the $SRCDIR

1. executed <pre>ikiwiki --setup .ikiwiki/ikiwiki.setup</pre>

1. found the test.html-file but is was not parsed for textile-syntax :-(
