This plugin allows wiki admins to configure the wiki using a web interface,
rather than editing the setup file directly. A "Wiki Setup" button is added to the
admins' preferences page.

Most settings can be modified using the web interface. Some settings are
not considered safe enough to be manipulated over the web; these are still
shown, by default, but cannot be modified. To hide them, set `websetup_show_unsafe` 
to false in the setup file. A few settings have too complex a data type
to be configured via the web.

The web interface can also be used to enable and disable plugins, with
limitations. The plugin for the [[revision_control_system|rcs]] being used
cannot be enabled/disabled, and no other rcs plugins can be enabled. A few
problematic/unsafe plugins are also blacklisted from being enabled. Other
plugins that should not be enabled/disabled via the web interface can be
listed in `websetup_force_plugins` in the setup file.
