This is an image handling plugin. While ikiwiki supports inlining full-size
images by making a [[WikiLink]] that points to the image, using this plugin
you can easily scale down an image for inclusion onto a page, providing a
link to a full-size version.

This plugin uses the [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/) tools via
[PerlMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/www/perl-magick.html).

Note that this is a stripped down version of Christian Mock's
[[original_img_plugin|contrib/img]].

## usage

	\[[img image1.jpg size="200x200" alt="clouds"]]

The image file will be searched for using the same rules as used to find
the file pointed to by a [[WikiLink]].

The `size` parameter is optional, defaulting to full size. Note that the
original image's aspect ratio is always preserved, even if this means
making the image smaller than the specified size.

You can also pass `alt`, `class` and `id` parameters. These are passed through
unchanged to the html img tag.

You can also set default values that will be applied to all later images on
the page, unless overridden. Useful when including many images on a page.

	\[[img defaults size=200x200 alt="wedding photo"]]
	\[[img photo1.jpg]]
	\[[img photo2.jpg]]
	\[[img photo3.jpg size=200x600]]
