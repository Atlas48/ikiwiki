This plugin allows inserting a randomly generated haiku into a wiki page.
Just type \\[[haiku hint="argument"]].

[[haiku hint="argument"]]

The hint parameter can be omitted, it only provides the generator a hint at
what to write the haiku about. If no hint is given, it might base it on the
page name. Since the vocabulary it knows is very small, many hints won't
affect the result at all.

This plugin is included in ikiwiki, but is not enabled by default.

You need to have the Coy module installed for this plugin to do anything
interesting. That does all the heavy lifting.
