This plugin implements the [[ikiwiki/directive/haiku]] [[ikiwiki/directive]].
The directive allows inserting a randomly generated haiku into a wiki page.

As a special bonus, enabling this plugin makes any error messages ikiwiki
should display be written in haiku.

You need to have the Coy module installed for this plugin to do anything
interesting. That does all the heavy lifting.
