Would there be a way for this plugin to emit fewer blank lines (i.e. *none at all*)?

For example, having a look at [this page](http://www.bddebian.com/~wiki/Hurd/)'s sidebar.
This [sidebar](http://www.bddebian.com/~wiki/sidebar/)
([source code](http://www.bddebian.com/gitweb/?p=wiki;a=blob_plain;f=sidebar.mdwn))
is supposed to have *no* blank lines between...

* **Hurd** and *About*,
* *Todo* and **Mach**,
* **Mach** and **Mig**.

> The blank lines in this example are coming from the newline after `then="`, and also from the newline before the close quote. If you remove those newlines, I think it should work. --[[Joey]]
