[[!template id=plugin name=more author="Ben"]]
[[!tag type/format]]

This plugin provides a way to have a "more" link on a page in a blog, that
leads to the full version of the page. Use it like this:

	\[[!more linktext="click for more" text="""
	This is the rest of my post. Not intended for people catching up on
	their blogs at 30,000 feet. Because I like to make things
	difficult.
	"""]]

If the `linktext` parameter is omitted it defaults to just "more".

Note that you can accomplish something similar using a [[toggle]] instead.
