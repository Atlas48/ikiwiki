This plugin generates a list of broken links on pages in the wiki. This is
a useful way to find pages that still need to be written, or links that
are written wrong.

The optional parameter "pages" can be a [[GlobList]] specifying the pages
to search for broken links, default is search them all.

This plugin is included in ikiwiki, but is not enabled by default.
If it is turned on, here's a list of broken links on this wiki:
