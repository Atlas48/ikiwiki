I've installed Text::WikiCreole 0.05 and enabled the plugin, but I get an error when rebuilding the wiki: `Undefined subroutine &IkiWiki::Plugin::creole::creole_custombarelinks called at /usr/pkg-20080723/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.8.0/IkiWiki/Plugin/creole.pm line 23`. Is there a newer Text::WikiCreole I'm not finding online?
