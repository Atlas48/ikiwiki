This plugin lets ikwiki convert files with names ending in ".rst" to html.
It uses the [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html)
markup syntax. You need to have the python-docutils module installed to use
it.

Note that this plugin does not interoperate very well with the rest of
ikiwiki. Limitations include:

* There are issues with inserting raw html into documents, as ikiwiki 
  does with [[WikiLinks|WikiLink]] and many 
  [[PreprocessorDirectives|PreprocessorDirective]].
* It's slow; it forks a copy of python for each page. While there is a
  perl version of the reStructuredText processor, it is not being kept in
  sync with the standard version, so is not used.

So while you may find this useful for importing old files into your wiki,
using this as your main markup language in ikiwiki isn't recommended at
this time.
