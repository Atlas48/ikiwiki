Maybe this is obvious, but the config variable lives in the IkiWiki module, and one probably 
wants to call defaultconfig for most applications. 
<pre>
%IkiWiki::config=IkiWiki::defaultconfig();
IkiWiki::Setup::load($config_file);
print  join(",",keys %IkiWiki::config);
</pre>

I'm a little concerned about one aspect of the `%wikistate` variable that was just introduced.
I think global state for each plugin is a fine idea, but I worry about making it persist across
rebuilds.  (And by rebuild, I assume we're talking about the `--rebuild` option.)

My reasoning is that a 'rebuild' should be similar to checking out a new copy of the wiki
and building.  Another way of saying this is that all permanent state should be in the RCS.
It is great that there is temporary state stored in other places - I think of it as indexing
and caching.  I'm worried that with the persistence, plugin writers will start putting data
there that isn't backed by the RCS and that will break IkiWiki's great abilities as a
distributed wiki.
