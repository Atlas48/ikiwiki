[[tag type/meta]]

This plugin allows inserting arbitrary metadata into the source of a page.
Enter the metadata as follows:

	\[[meta field="value"]]
	\[[meta field="value" param="value" param="value"]]

The first form sets a given field to a given value, while the second form
also specifies some additional sub-parameters.

You can use any field names you like, but here are some predefined ones:

* link

  Specifies a link to another page. This is used to generate a html
  &lt;link&gt; tag, and also as a way to make the wiki treat one page as
  linking to another without displaying a user-visible link. The latter 
  can be useful when using links to categorise pages. A html link tag
  would look like this:

	\[[meta link="foo.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"]]

  A non-user-visible [[WikiLink]] would instead look like this:

	\[[meta link=otherpage]]

* title

  Overrides the title of the page, which is generally the same as the
  page name.

  Note that if the title is overridden, a "title_overridden" variable will
  be set to a true value in the template; this can be used to format things
  differently in this case.

* license

  Specifies a copyright license for the page, for example, "GPL".

* author

  Specifies the author of a page.

* permalink

  Specifies a permanent link to the page, if different than the page
  generated by ikiwiki.

If the field is not treated specially (as the link and title fields are),
the metadata will be written to the generated html page as a &lt;meta&gt;
header.

The field value is treated as HTML entity-escaped text, so you can include
a quote in the text by writing `&quot;` and so on.

If this plugin is enabled, the title of this page will say that it is.
