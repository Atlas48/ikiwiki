This plugin adds full text search to ikiwiki, using the
[xapian](http://xapian.org/) engine, its
[omega](http://xapian.org/docs/omega/overview.html) frontend,
and the [[cpan Search::Xapian]] perl module. (The [[cpan HTML::Scrubber]]
perl module will also be used, if available.)

Ikiwiki will handle indexing new and changed page contents. Note that it
indexes page contents before they are preprocessed and converted to html,
as this tends to produce less noisy search results. Also, since it only
indexes page contents, files copied by the [[rawhtml]] plugin will not be
indexed, nor will other types of data files.

There is one setting you may need to use in the config file. `omega_cgi` 
should point to the location of the omega cgi program. The default location
is `/usr/lib/cgi-bin/omega/omega`.
