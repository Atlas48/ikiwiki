This plugin is included in ikiwiki, but is not enabled by default. It adds
full text search to ikiwiki, using the [[HyperEstraier]] engine.

It's possible to configure HyperEstraier via one of ikiwiki's
[[templates]], but for most users, no configuration should be needed aside
from enabling the plugin.
