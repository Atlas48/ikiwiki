I'm trying to convert hand written html site to ikiwiki and maintain url compatibility. 
html plugin with indexpages=1 converts all dir_name/index.html correctly dir_name urls with wiki/css
based content, but somedir/somefile.html files are only accessible as somedir/somefile/.

How to make somedir/somefile.html accessible as somedir/somefile.html under ikiwiki?
