It would be nice if the "month" type calendar could collect all of the 
matching pages on a given date in some inline type way. --[[DavidBremner]]

Is it possible to get the calendar to link to pages based not on their timestamp (as I understand that it does now, or have I misunderstood this?) and instead on for example their location in a directory hierarchy. That way the calendar could be used as a planning / timeline device which I think would be great. --[[Alexander]]
