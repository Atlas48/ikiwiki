It would be useful (at least for me) if one could specify
(using a [[WikiLink]]) where the image links to.  For example,
on <http://www.bddebian.com/~wiki/sidebar/> I'd like to have the
logo link to \[[hurd/logo]] / <http://www.bddebian.com/~wiki/hurd/logo/>
instead of linking to the PNG image file.  --[[tschwinge]]
