# Nested plugins

Is it possible to use another plugin into your toggle plugin? For example,
I want to have toggleable table and try to use Victor Moral's table plugin,
but no success. How can I do it?

# Bug when followed by a heading

Ikiwiki fails to render the line break between *foo* and *bar* when the following is toggled on:

[[toggle id="test" text="show"]]
[[toggleable id="test" text="""
    foo
"""]]


## bar

For some reason, this problem is not visible here.  You can see the problem on
<http://www.bddebian.com/~wiki/microkernel/mach/gnumach/hardwarecompatibilitylist/>.
Scroll down to *Storage* and use the *SATA drives ...* toggle.  --[[tschwinge]]


# Bug when toggling in a preview page

When toggling an item while being in a web-editing session in the *Preview* frame,
you'll lose the context of the editing session and will be directed to the wiki's
main page instead.  --[[tschwinge]]
