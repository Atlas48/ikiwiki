This plugin lets raw html pages be used as source pages for the wiki. The
html pages will still be wrapped in the same html template as any other
page, so for best results you should include only the page body in the html
file. Also, if the htmlscrubber plugin is enabled, the html pages will be
sanitised like any other page. You can also use standard [[WikiLink]]s etc
in the html pages.

This plugin is included in ikiwiki, but is not enabled by default.
