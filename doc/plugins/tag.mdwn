This plugin allows tagging pages. List tags as follows:

	\\[[tag tech life linux]]

The tags work the same as if you had put a (hidden) [[WikiLink]] on the page
for each tag, so you can use a [[GlobList]] to link to all pages that are
tagged with a given tag, for example.

This plugin is included in ikiwiki, but is not enabled by default.
