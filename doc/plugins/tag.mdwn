[[!tag type/tags type/link]]

This plugin provides the [[ikiwiki/directive/tag]] and 
[[ikiwiki/directive/taglink]] [[directives|ikiwiki/directive]].
These directives allow tagging pages.

It also provides the `tagged()` [[ikiwiki/PageSpec]], which can be used to
match pages that are tagged with a specific tag.

If the `tag_autocreate` setting is enabled, tag pages will automatically be
created as needed.

[[!if test="enabled(tag)" then="""
This wiki has the tag plugin enabled, so you'll see a note below that this
page is tagged with the "tags" tag.
