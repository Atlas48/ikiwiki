This plugin allows tagging pages. List tags as follows:

	\[[tag tech life linux]]

The tags work the same as if you had put a (hidden) [[WikiLink]] on the page
for each tag, so you can use a [[GlobList]] to link to all pages that are
tagged with a given tag, for example. The tags will also show up on blog
entries and at the bottom of the tagged pages, as well as in rss feeds.

This plugin has a configuration option. Set --tagbase=tag and all tags will
be located inside a "tag" subdirectory, This is a useful way to avoid having
to write the full path to tags, if you want to keep them grouped together out
of the way.

This plugin is included in ikiwiki, but is not enabled by default. If it is
enabled, you'll see a note below that this page is tagged with the "tags"
tag.
