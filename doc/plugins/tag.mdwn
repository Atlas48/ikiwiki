[[!tag type/tags type/link]]

This plugin provides the [[ikiwiki/directive/tag]] and 
[[ikiwiki/directive/taglink]] [[directives|ikiwiki/directive]].
These directives allow tagging pages.

This plugin has a configuration option. Set --tagbase=tags and links to tags
will be located under the specified base page. If ikiwiki is configured
this way, then the example above actually tags the page with the tags
tags/tech, tags/life, and tags/linux. This is a useful way to avoid
having to write the full path to tags, if you want to keep them grouped
together out of the way.
