Would it be possible to add an option to only generate the index files
for the html output and not place the markdown files in the wiki source?

The reason being that I have a lot of directories which need to be autoindexed,
but I would prefer if the index files didn't clutter up my git repository.

even without that feature the plugin is a great help, thanks
