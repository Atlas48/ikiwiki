[[!template id=plugin name=rsync author="[[schmonz]]"]]

This plugin allows ikiwiki to push generated pages to another host
by running a command such as `rsync`.

The command to run is specified by setting `rsync_command` in your setup
file. The command will be run in your destdir, so something like this
is a typical command:

	rsync -qa --delete . user\@host:/path/to/docroot/ --exclude ikiwiki.cgi

If using rsync over ssh, you will need to enable noninteractive ssh login
to the remote host. It's also a good idea to specify the exact command line
to be permitted in the remote host's `$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys`.

Be sure to exclude the `ikiwiki.cgi` wrapper from being sent to the remote
host.
