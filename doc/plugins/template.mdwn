With this plugin, you can set up templates, and cause them to be filled out
and inserted into pages in the wiki. Using a template works like this:

	\[[template id=foo name="Charley" color="red" age=11]]

This fills out the template `templates/foo`, filling in the `color` and `age`
fields on it with the specified values, and inserts the result into the page.

(Note that if the template doesn't exist, the page will provide a link that
can be used to create it.)

A value can include any markup that would be allowed in the wiki page
outside the template. Triple-quoting the value even allows quotes to be
included in it. Combined with multi-line quoted values, this allows for
large chunks of marked up text to be embedded into a template:

	\[[template id=foo name="Sally" color="green" age=8 notes="""
	* \[[Charley]]'s sister.
	* "I want to be an astronaut when I grow up."
	* Really 8 and a half.
	"""]]

To create a template, make a page in the wiki named `template/foo`. Note
that this is a different location than the directory used for the
[[templates]] used to build the wiki itself, which is not inside the wiki.

The template uses the syntax used by the [[cpan HTML::Template]] perl
module, which allows for some fairly complex things to be done. Consult its
documentation for the full syntax, but all you really need to know are a
few things:

* To insert the value of a variable, use `<TMPL_VAR variable>`.
* To make a block of text conditional on a variable being set use
  `<TMPL_IF NAME="variable">text</TMPL_IF>`.
* To use one block of text if a variable is set and a second if it's not,
  use `<TMPL_IF NAME="variable">text<TMPL_ELSE>other text</TMPL_IF>`

Here's a sample template:

	<span class="infobox">
	Name: <TMPL_VAR name><br />
	Age: <TMPL_VAR age><br />
	<TMPL_IF NAME="color">
	Favorite color: <TMPL_VAR color><br />
	<TMPL_ELSE>
	No favorite color.<br />
	</TMPL_IF>
	<TMPL_IF NAME="notes">
	<hr />
	<TMPL_VAR notes>
	</TMPL_IF>
	</span>
