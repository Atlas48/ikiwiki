[[template id=plugin name=aggregate author="[[Joey]]"]]
[[tag type/useful]]

This plugin allows content from other feeds to be aggregated into the wiki.
Aggregate a feed as follows

	\[[aggregate name="example blog"
	feedurl="http://example.com/index.rss"
	url="http://example.com/" updateinterval="15"]]

That example aggregates posts from the specified RSS feed, updating no
more frequently than once every 15 minutes, and puts a page per post under
the example/ directory in the wiki.

You can then use ikiwiki's [[ikiwiki/blog]] support to create a blog of one or
more aggregated feeds.

## setup

Make sure that you have the [[html]] plugin enabled, as the created pages are
in html format. The [[meta]] and [[tag]] plugins are also recommended. The
[[htmltidy]] plugin is suggested, since feeds can easily contain html
problems, some of which tidy can fix.

You will need to run ikiwiki periodically from a cron job, passing it the
--aggregate parameter, to make it check for new posts. Here's an example
crontab entry:

	*/15 * * * * ikiwiki --setup my.wiki --aggregate --refresh

Alternatively, you can allow `ikiwiki.cgi` to trigger the aggregation. You
should only need this if for some reason you cannot use cron, and instead
want to use a service such as [WebCron](http://webcron.org). To enable
this, enable on `aggregate_webtrigger` in your setup file. The url to
visit is `http://whatever/ikiwiki.cgi?do=aggregate_webtrigger`. Anyone
can visit the url to trigger an aggregation run, but it will only check
each feed if its `updateinterval` has passed.

## usage

Here are descriptions of all the supported parameters to the `aggregate`
directive:

* `name` - A name for the feed. Each feed must have a unique name.
  Required.
* `url` - The url to the web page for the feed that's being aggregated.
  Required.
* `dir` - The directory in the wiki where pages should be saved. Optional,
  if not specified, the directory is based on the name of the feed.
* `feedurl` - The url to the feed. Optional, if it's not specified ikiwiki
  will look for feeds on the `url`. RSS and atom feeds are supported.
* `updateinterval` - How often to check for new posts, in minutes. Default
  is 15 minutes.
* `expireage` - Expire old items from this feed if they are older than
  a specified number of days. Default is to never expire on age.
* `expirecount` - Expire old items from this feed if there are more than
  the specified number total. Oldest items will be expired first. Default
  is to never expire on count.
* `tag` - A tag to tag each post from the feed with. A good tag to use is
  the name of the feed. Can be repeated multiple times. The [[tag]] plugin
  must be enabled for this to work.

Note that even if you are using subversion or another revision control
system, pages created by aggregation will *not* be checked into revision
control.
