First, thanks again for making this plugin.

I don't know if this is a problem for [[plugins/attachment]], but there seems to
be no way to detect text/plain using File::MimeInfo::Magic::magic().
There is a heuristic ::default that decides between text/plain and application/octet-stream.  

Would you be receptive to a patch that e.g. called File::MimeInfo::Magic::default()
if ::magic() returns undef?  --[[DavidBremner]]
