[[!template id=plugin name=listdirectives author="Will"]]
[[!tag type/meta]]

This plugin generates a list of available
[[directives|ikiwiki/directive]].

	\[[!listdirectives]]

Each directive links to a wiki page with the same name. The location of the
pages in the wiki can be controlled via the `directive_description_dir`
setting in the setup file.

There is one optional keyword argument, `generated`.  Normally the `listdirectives` directive will
list all built in directives and directives directly registered by [[plugins]].  With this keyword,
`listdirectives` will also list directives generated later.  For example, all [[shortcuts]] are
directives generated in turn by the `shortcut` directive.  They will only be listed if the `generated` argument is
supplied.

    \[[!listdirectives generated]]

This extended list is often quite long, and often contains many undocumented directives.
