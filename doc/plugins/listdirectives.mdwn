This plugin provides the [[ikiwiki/directive/linkmap]] [[ikiwiki/directive]].
The linkmap directive inserts a list of currently available directives into the page.

Each directive links to a wiki page with the same name. The location of the
pages in the wiki can be controlled via the `directive_description_dir`
setting in the setup file.
