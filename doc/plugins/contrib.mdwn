# Installing third party plugins

Plugins are perl modules and should be installed somewhere in the perl
module search path. See the @INC list at the end of the output of `perl -V`
for a list of the directories in that path. All plugins are in the
IkiWiki::Plugin namespace, so they go in a IkiWiki/Plugin subdirectory
inside the perl search path. For example, if your perl looks in
`/usr/local/lib/site_perl` for modules, you can locally install ikiwiki
plugins to `/usr/local/lib/site_perl/IkiWiki/Plugin`
