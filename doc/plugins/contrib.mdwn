# Installing third party plugins

Most ikiwiki plugins are perl modules and should be installed somewhere in
the perl module search path. See the @INC list at the end of the output of
`perl -V` for a list of the directories in that path. All plugins are in
the IkiWiki::Plugin namespace, so they go in a IkiWiki/Plugin subdirectory
inside the perl search path. For example, if your perl looks in
`/usr/local/lib/site_perl` for modules, you can locally install ikiwiki
plugins to `/usr/local/lib/site_perl/IkiWiki/Plugin`

You can use the `libdir` configuration option to add a directory to the
search path. For example, if you set `libdir` to `/home/you/.ikiwiki/`,
then ikiwiki will look for plugins in `/home/you/.ikiwiki/IkiWiki/Plugins`.

Ikiwiki also supports plugins that are external programs. These are
typically written in some other language than perl. Ikiwiki searches for
these in /usr/lib/ikiwiki/plugins by default. If `libdir` is set, it will
also look in that directory, for example in `/home/you/.ikiwiki/plugins`.
