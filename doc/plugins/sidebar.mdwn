If this plugin is enabled, then a sidebar is added to pages in the wiki.
The content of the sidebar is simply the content of a page named
"sidebar".

Typically this will be a page in the root of the wiki, but it can also be a
[[SubPage]]. In fact, this page, [[plugins/sidebar|plugins/sidebar]], will
be treated as a sidebar for the [[plugins]] page, and of all of its
SubPages, if the plugin is enabled.

This plugin is included in ikiwiki, but is not enabled by default.
