## How to only have editpage link when admin is logged in? Or on secret page?

I saw [[todo/Allow_disabling_edit_and_preferences_links]] but not sure if that is what I want.

I want to have edit links to maintain site. (I am currently manually using vi and cvs on server or pasting in ikiwiki.cgi to browser location bar.) But I do not want the regular (non-admin) visitors to see the edit link.

Any suggestions?

Can two different websites be regenerated at the same time? Or is there any CSS or other template magic I can use to selectively show the EDITURL?

I do have a secret page that I use to add new blog entry (postform).
