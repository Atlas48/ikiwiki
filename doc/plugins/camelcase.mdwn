[[template id=plugin name=camelcase author="[[Joey]]"]]

This plugin makes words in CamelCase be treated as a [[WikiLink]]. That is
to say, any two or more words capitalised and mashed together are assumed
to be the name of some other page on the wiki, and so become a link.

If this plugin is enabled, this will be a link: SandBox

[[tag type/link]]
