This plugin adds a search form to the wiki, using google's site search.

Google is asked to search for pages in the domain specified in the wiki's
`url` configuration parameter. Results will depend on whether google has
indexed the site, and how recently. Also, if the same domain has other
content, outside the wiki's content, it will be searched as well.

The [[search]] plugin offers full text search of only the wiki, but
requires that a search engine be installed on your site.
