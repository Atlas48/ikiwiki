Well, that's an one workaround for (some versions of) markdown's
lack of tables..

Interesting that you chose to use CSV format. Seems there are advantages
(standardisation) and disadvantages (limited to simple tables).

# Patch for new header options

I have written a small patch for this plugin to enable the first column as a header instead of just the first row or no header.

In my version, there is three options for the header field :

+ **no**: no header;
+ **col**: the first column as header;
+ **row**: the first row as header (for compatibility reason, **yes** is an alternate value for this option). 

Here is the links to the patch and to a patched version of the plugin :

+ [table.pm.patch](http://alexandre.dupas.free.fr/code/ikiwiki/table.pm.patch)
+ [table.pm](http://alexandre.dupas.free.fr/code/ikiwiki/table.pm)

I hope this might be intresting for some ikiwiki user's.
