This plugin allows inserting text generated by polygen into a wiki page.
For example:

	\[[polygen grammar="genius"]]

It's also possible to specify a starting nonterminal for the grammar by
including `symbol="text"` in the directive.

This plugin is included in ikiwiki, but not enabled by default.

If this plugin is enabled, and polygen is installed, here are a few notes
about ikiwiki.

----

Ikiwiki is internally based on a [[polygen grammar="designpatterns"]]
coupled to a [[polygen grammar="designpatterns"]], as described in
"[[polygen grammar="paper2"]]" by [[polygen grammar="nipponame"]] of
[[polygen grammar="boyband"]].
