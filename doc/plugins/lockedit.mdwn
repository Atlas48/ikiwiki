This plugin allows the administrator of a wiki to lock some pages, limiting
who can edit them using the online interface. This doesn't prevent anyone
who can commit to the underlying revision control system from editing the
pages, however.

The `locked_pages` setting configures what pages are locked. It is a
[[ikiwiki/PageSpec]], so you have lots of control over what kind of pages
to lock. For example, you could choose to lock all pages created before
2006, or all pages that are linked to from the page named "locked". More
usually though, you'll just list some names of pages to lock.

One handy thing to do if you're using ikiwiki for your blog is to lock
"* and !*/Discussion". This prevents others from adding to or modifying
posts in your blog, while still letting them comment via the Discussion
pages.

Wiki administrators can always edit locked pages. The [[ikiwiki/PageSpec]]
can specify that some pages are not locked for some users. For example,
"important_page and !user(joey)" locks `important_page` while still
allowing joey to edit it, while "!*/Discussion and user(bob)" prevents bob
from editing pages except for Discussion pages.
