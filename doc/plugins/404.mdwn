This plugin lets you use the IkiWiki CGI script as an Apache 404 handler,
to give the behaviour of various other wiki engines where visiting a
nonexistent page provides you with a link to create it.

To achieve this, put something like this in the wiki's Apache configuration
file:

    ErrorDocument 404 /ikiwiki.cgi

(The path here needs to be whatever the path is to the ikiwiki.cgi from
the root of your web server.)

This plugin might also be useful on some non-Apache web servers, if they provide the
`REDIRECT_STATUS` and `REDIRECT_URL` environment variables to their 404 handlers.
`REDIRECT_STATUS` should be `404` and `REDIRECT_URL` should be the path
part of the URL (for instance it would be `/plugins/404/` if this page was missing).

If you would like help with adapting this plugin for a different web server,
you will need to provide the output of
[[this 404 handler|forum/nginx:_404_plugin_not_working#comment-6b1607f7961d2873517d4780f56ac3ad]].
