[[!template id=plugin name=orphans author="[[Joey]]"]]
[[!tag type/meta]]

This plugin generates a list of possibly orphaned pages -- pages that no
other page links to.

The optional parameter "pages" can be a [[ikiwiki/PageSpec]] specifying the
pages to check for orphans, default is search them all.

Note that it takes [[BackLinks]] into account, but does not count inlining a
page as linking to it, so will generally count many blog-type pages as
orphans.

[[!if test="enabled(orphans)" then="""
Here's a list of orphaned pages on this wiki:

[[!orphans pages="* and !news/* and !todo/* and !bugs/* and !users/* and
!recentchanges and !examples/* and !tips/* and !sandbox/* and !templates/* and
!wikiicons/* and !plugins/*"]]
