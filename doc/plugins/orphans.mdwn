This plugin generates a list of possibly orphaned pages -- pages that no
other page links to.

The optional parameter "pages" can be a [[PageSpec]] specifying the pages
to check for orphans, default is search them all.

Note that it takes [[BackLinks]] into account, but does not count inlining a
page as linking to it, so will generally count many blog-type pages as
orphans.
