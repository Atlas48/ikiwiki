[[template id=plugin name=recentchanges core=1 author="[[Joey]]"]]

This plugin examines the [[revision_control_system|rcs]] history and
generates a page describing each recent change made to the wiki. These
pages can be joined together with [[inline]] to generate the
[[RecentChanges]] page.

Typically only the RecentChanges page will use the plugin, but you can
use it elsewhere too if you like. It's used like this:

	\[[recentchanges pages="*" num=100 template=change]]

The pages describing recent changes will be created as [[subpages|subpage]]
of the page where the `recentchanges` directive is placed.
