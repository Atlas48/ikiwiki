[[template id=plugin name=recentchanges core=1 author="[[Joey]]"]]

This plugin examines the [[revision_control_system|rcs]] history and
generates a page describing each recent change made to the wiki. These
pages can be joined together with [[inline]] to generate the
[[RecentChanges]] page.

Typically only the RecentChanges page will use the pages generated by this
plugin, but you can use it elsewhere too if you like. It's used like this:

	\[[inline pages="internal(recentchanges/change_*)"
	template=recentchanges show=0]]

Here's an example of how to show only changes to "bugs/*".
This matches against the title of the change, which includes a list of
modified pages.

	\[[inline pages="internal(recentchanges/change_*) and title(*bugs/*)"
	template=recentchanges show=0]]

Here's an example of how to show only changes that Joey didn't make.
(Joey commits sometimes as user `joey`, and sometimes via openid.)
	
	\[[inline pages="internal(recentchanges/change_*) and
	!author(joey) and !author(http://joey.kitenet.net*)"
	template=recentchanges show=0]]
