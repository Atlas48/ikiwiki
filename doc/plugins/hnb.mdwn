This plugin allows ikiwiki to process `.hnb` XML files, as created by 
the Hierachical Notebook [hnb](http://hnb.sourceforge.net/). To use it, you need to have 
hnb installed, since it uses the commandline interface of `hnb` program.

It is roughly based on the `otl` plugin but uses `mktemp` to create temporary files since `hnb` has no "quiet" switch and otherwise the hnb version number and other as well as the output file name always would be in the output itself.

For now [[XTaran]]'s currently used version is available for download at <http://noone.org/hnb/hnb.pm>. The Mercurial repository is at <http://noone.org/hg/IkiWiki/Plugin>.

The hnb plugin is available under the GPL.
