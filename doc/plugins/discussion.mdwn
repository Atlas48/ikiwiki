Maybe we can have a page for requesting a plugin? (Not from the head developer but other ikiwiki end-users.)

I have seen a few requests on discussion pages, but not any place specific I think.

Some requests:

- rcs plugin ([[JeremyReed]] has one he has been using for over a month with over 850 web commits with 13 users with over ten commits each.)

- manpage plugin: convert **"ls(1)"** style content into Markdown like **\[ls(1)\]\(http://example.org/man.cgi?name=ls&sect=1\)** or into HTML directly.
