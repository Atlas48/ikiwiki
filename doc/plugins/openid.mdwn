This plugin allows users to use their [OpenID](http://openid.net/) to log
into the wiki.

The plugin needs the `Net::OpenID::Consumer` perl module. The
`LWPx::ParanoidAgent` perl module is used if available, for added
security. Finally, the `Crypt::SSLeay` perl module is needed to support
users entering "https" OpenID urls.

This plugin is included in ikiwiki, but is not enabled by default.
