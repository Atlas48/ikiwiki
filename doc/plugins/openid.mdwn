[[!template id=plugin name=openid core=1 author="[[Joey]]"]]
[[!tag type/auth]]

This plugin allows users to use their [OpenID](http://openid.net/) to log
into the wiki.

The plugin needs the [[!cpan Net::OpenID::Consumer]] perl module.
Version 1.x is needed in order for OpenID v2 to work.

The [[!cpan LWPx::ParanoidAgent]] perl module is used if available, for
added security. Finally, the [[!cpan Crypt::SSLeay]] perl module is needed
to support users entering "https" OpenID urls.

This plugin is enabled by default, but can be turned off if you want to
only use some other form of authentication, such as [[passwordauth]].
