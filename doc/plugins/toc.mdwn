[[template id=plugin name=toc author="[[Joey]]"]]
[[tag type/chrome]]

Add a table of contents to a page:

	\[[toc ]]

The table of contents will be automatically generated based on the
headers of the page. By default only the largest headers present on the
page will be shown; to control how many levels of headers are shown, use
the `levels` parameter:

	\[[toc levels=2]]

The toc plugin will take the level of the first header as the topmost
level, even if there are higher levels seen later in the file.

The table of contents will be created as an ordered list. If you want
an unordered list instead, you can change the list-style in your local
style sheet.
