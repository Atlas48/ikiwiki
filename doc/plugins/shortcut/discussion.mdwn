I'd like to use a shortcut like \[[gnumach-1-branch ddb/db_expr.h]] to link to
<http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/gnumach/ddb/db_expr.h?view=log&root=hurd&pathrev=gnumach-1-branch>.

* Dashes are not allowed in shortcut identifiers.  Why?

* The URL is rewritten to
    <http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/gnumach/ddb%2Fdb%5Fexpr%2Eh?view=log&root=hurd&pathrev=gnumach-1-branch>,
    which the remove server doesn't like.  Mind the esacping of [^A-Za-z0-9].
    Might this be a problem of the web server?

Also, I'd like to put the shortcut usages into backticks
-- `[[iki shortcuts]]` --
to have them displayed in the usual backtick-formatting.
That also doesn't work, but this is an already-reported issue, as far as I know.
