The `transient` plugin is an implementation of [[todo/transient pages]]
in an underlay. It's mostly useful as something other plugins can depend on;
[[plugins/contrib/album]] puts photo-album "viewer" pages there,
and the versions of [[plugins/autoindex]] and [[plugins/tag]] on the
same branch optionally put their auto-generated pages there.
