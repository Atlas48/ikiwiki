This plugin sounds exactly like what I need! I too have sources I want to compile on the fly,
such as diagrams made with Dia and perhaps API reference manuals made with Doxygen.

I'd like to use it, but -

Problem: Any user can change the command to something dangerous that deletes file and
causes irreversible damage to the system. I can even happen by mistake.

Suggestion: Add an option to the setup file that forbids to override the build command in the
directive, and then only the setup file can configure build commands (if you want).

What do you think?
