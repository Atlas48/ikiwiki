[[template id=plugin name=plaintext author="[[JeremieKoenig]]"]]
[[tag type/format]]

I was surprised that no plugin seems to be available to render plaintext pages;
as I need one to implement the "[[todo/preview_changes]]" todo item,
I quickly wrote it. Maybe this can be included in ikiwiki?

This plugins changes `<`, `>` and `&` characters into the
corresponding entities (`&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&amp;`), and wraps its input inside
a `<pre>`...`</pre>` tag. I'm not sure if this is sufficient.
