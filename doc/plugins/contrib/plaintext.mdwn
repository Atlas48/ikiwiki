[[template id=plugin name=plaintext author="[[JeremieKoenig]]"]]
[[tag type/format]]

I was surprised that no plugin seems to be available to render plaintext pages;
as I need one to implement the "[[todo/preview_changes]]" todo item,
I quickly wrote it. Maybe this can be included in ikiwiki?

This plugins uses HTML::Entities::encode_entities() on the page's content
and wraps it in a `<pre>`...`</pre>` tag.
