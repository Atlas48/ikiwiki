Textile is a veratile markup language.  So here's a trivial (in that it is a
direct adaptation of the wikitext plugin) plugin that will use the Textile 
markup language to render .txtl files in your data directory.  You must have 
[[cpan Text::Textile]] installed for it to work. Naturally, it is released under
the terms of the GPL.
