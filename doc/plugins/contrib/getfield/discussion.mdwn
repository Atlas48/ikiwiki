## Templating, and other uses

Like you mentioned in [[ftemplate]] IIRC, it'll only work on the same page. If it can be made to work anywhere, or from a specific place in the wiki - configurable, possibly - you'll have something very similar to mediawiki's templates. I can already think of a few uses for this combined with [[template]] ;) . --[[SR|users/simonraven]]

>> I don't know the internals very well, I think that's how other plugins do it. *goes to check* Usually it's a `foreach` loop, and use a `pagestate{foo}` to check the page's status/state. There's also some stuff like 'pagespec_match_list($params{page}` ... they do slightly different thing depending on need. --[[SR|users/simonraven]]

> I'm also working on a "report" plugin, which will basically apply a template like [[ftemplate]] does, but to a list of pages given from a pagespec, rather than the current page.
