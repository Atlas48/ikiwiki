## Templating, and other uses

Like you mentioned in [[ftemplate]] IIRC, it'll only work on the same page. If it can be made to work anywhere, or from a specific place in the wiki - configurable, possibly - you'll have something very similar to mediawiki's templates. I can already think of a few uses for this combined with [[template]] ;) . --[[SR|users/simonraven]]
