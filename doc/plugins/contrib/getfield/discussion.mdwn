## Templating, and other uses

Like you mentioned in [[ftemplate]] IIRC, it'll only work on the same page. If it can be made to work anywhere, or from a specific place in the wiki - configurable, possibly - you'll have something very similar to mediawiki's templates. I can already think of a few uses for this combined with [[template]] ;) . --[[SR|users/simonraven]]

> It needs to resolve to a single page, though I guess using "bestlink" to find the closest page would mean that one didn't have to spell out the whole page.

> I'm also working on a "report" plugin, which will basically apply a template like [[ftemplate]] does, but to a list of pages given from a pagespec, rather than the current page.
