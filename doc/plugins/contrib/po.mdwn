I've been working on a plugin called "po", that adds support for multi-lingual wikis,
translated with gettext, using [po4a](http://po4a.alioth.debian.org/).

More information:

* It can be found in [my "po" branch](http://repo.or.cz/w/ikiwiki/intrigeri.git?a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/po): `git clone git://repo.or.cz/ikiwiki/intrigeri.git`
* It involves adding three hooks to ikiwiki core.
* It is documented (including TODO and plans for next work steps) in `doc/plugins/po.mdwn`, which can be found in the same branch.
* No public demo site is available so far, I'm working on this.

My plan is to get this plugin clean enough to be included in ikiwiki.

The current version is a proof-of-concept, mature enough for me to dare submitting it here,
but I'm prepared to hear various helpful remarks, and to rewrite parts of it as needed.

Any thoughts on this?
