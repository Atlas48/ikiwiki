This plugin allows ikiwiki to process `.hnb` XML files, as created by 
the Hierachical Notebook [hnb](http://hnb.sourceforge.net/). To use it, you need to have 
hnb installed, since it uses the commandline interface of `hnb` program.

It is roughly based on the `otl` plugin but uses `mktemp` to create temporary files since `hnb` has no "quiet" switch and otherwise the hnb version number and other as well as the output file name always would be in the output itself.

For now it's available for download at [http://noone.org/hnb/hnb.pm](http://noone.org/hnb/hnb.pm)

TODO: Make a switch to allow both HTML export routines of hnb (`export_html` and `export_htmlcss`) to be used.
