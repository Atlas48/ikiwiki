[[!template id=plugin name=img author="Franek"]]

This is a trivial modification of the [[plugins/favicon]] plugin to allow different favicons for different parts of the site. For this, the option "localfavicon" has to be set to 1 in the setup file, otherwise the plugin behaves just like the favicon plugin.

For now, it can be downloaded here: [[http://perm.lemtank.de/localfavicon.pm]]
