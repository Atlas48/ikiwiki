Is this actually necessary? Doesn't the combination of [[plugins/template]]
with [[plugins/contrib/field]]'s `pagetemplate` hook provide the same
functionality? I suppose one missing thing is that `ftemplate` looks in
the "system" templates directories, not just in the wiki, but that
seems orthogonal (and might even be a good enhancement to `template`).
