I initially thought this wasn't actually necessary - the combination
of [[plugins/template]] with [[plugins/contrib/field]]'s `pagetemplate`
hook ought to provide the same functionality. However, `template`
doesn't run `pagetemplate` hooks; a more general version of this
plugin would be to have a variant of `template` that runs `pagetemplate`
hooks (probably easiest to just patch `template` to implement a
second directive, or have a special parameter `run_hooks="yes"`,
or something).

Another missing thing is that `ftemplate` looks in
the "system" templates directories, not just in the wiki, but that
seems orthogonal (and might be a good enhancement to `template` anyway).
