[[meta title="default content for *copyright* and *license*"]]

Someone was just asking for it and I had written these two plugins already some months ago,
so I'm now publishing them here.

<http://www.schwinge.homeip.net/~thomas/tmp/copyright.pm>
<http://www.schwinge.homeip.net/~thomas/tmp/license.pm>

/!\ Note that there is still an issue to be resolved with these plugins: have a look at
[tmpfs](http://www.bddebian.com/~wiki/hurd/translator/tmpfs/).  There are two inlined pages,
[tmpfs-notes\_bing](http://www.bddebian.com/~wiki/hurd/translator/tmpfs/notes_bing/) and
[tmpfs-notes\_various](http://www.bddebian.com/~wiki/hurd/translator/tmpfs/notes_various/).
Compare the *copyright* and *license* information of the inlined pages on *tmpfs* to those
on the source pages, *tmpfs-notes_bing* and *tmpfs-notes_various*.
They are different, but shouldn't be.
