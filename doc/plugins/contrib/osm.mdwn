Openstreetmap/Openlayers support for ikiwiki
--------------------------------------------

This plugin provides simple Openstreetmap/Openlayers support for ikiwiki. It can embed Openstreetmap viewports within a page or link to a bigger map that will have multiple markers, generated with a KML (or CSV, or GeoJSON) datafile of markers based on the different calling pages. Multiple distinct maps on a single wiki are supported.

Plugin was originally written by [[the techno-viking|http://techno-viking.com/posts/ikiwiki-maps/]] and fixed up by [[anarcat]]. Code is available at `git://src.anarcat.ath.cx/ikiwiki-osm.git`.

See also [[plugins/contrib/googlemaps]].

This plugin would be greatly improved by [[todo/internal_definition_list_support]].
