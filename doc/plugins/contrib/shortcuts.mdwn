Note: This plugin is different than the "shortcut" plugin now included in
ikiwiki. I'm leaving it here in case people prefer how this one works.
--[[Joey]]

*shortcuts* is a plugin for make external links easy in a ikiwiki page.
It filter the raw source code, searching *wafl expresions* and replacing it
for ikiwiki links and not for html links. 

*Note: my apologies for my poor english, my mother language is the spanish.
Any corrections are welcome :-).*

In the source page you need include the expresions as:

    For my {wiki:UPS} APC i need the {deb:apcupsd} package installed. You can 
    found {google:apc linux|many positive responses}.

and after filter this is the result:

    For my [UPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UPS) i need the 
    [apcupsd](http://packages.debian.org/). You can found 
    [many positive responses](http://www.google.com/search?q=apc+linux).

If you need escape a walf expression prefix with a backslash character as in:

    This is a \{cpan:example}.

This module is inspired in Kwiki::Shortcuts with minor diferences. The wafl
expresions are strings between braces with the following elements:

* one name (followed by one colon character)
* one o many search terms
* an optional text for the link

The plugin provides some predefined shortcuts, and it can use a external
definitions file. This file is named *shortcuts.conf* by default, but it can
be set with the *shortcuts* parameter and configuration variable.

The next shortcuts are predefined:

-   google: http://www.google.com/search?q=
-   deb:    http://packages.debian.org/
-   dbug:   http://bugs.debian.org/
-   cpan:   http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=dist&query=
-   wiki:   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/

Use the external Perl module: URI::Escape and it can be found
[here](http://taquiones.net/files/misc/IkiWiki-Plugin-shortcuts-0.3.tar.gz).
