## security

I'm curious what the security implications of having this plugin on a
publically writable wiki are.

First, it looks like the way it looks up the stylesheet file will happily
use a regular .mdwn wiki page as the stylsheet. Which means any user can
create a stylesheet and have it be used, without needing permission to
upload arbitrary files. That probably needs to be fixed; one way would be
to mandate that the `srcfile` has a `.xsl` extension.

Secondly, if an attacker is able to upload a stylesheet file somehow, could
this be used to attack the server where it is built? I know that xslt is
really a full programming language, so I assume at least DOS attacks are
possible. Can it also read other arbitrary files, run other programs, etc?
