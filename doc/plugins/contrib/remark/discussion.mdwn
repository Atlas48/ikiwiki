## Problem: `inline` <a id="inline"></a>

Web slides are sort of a regular web page, but not exactly: no action
links, and almost none of the other accoutrements of `page.tmpl`. The
branch's current behavior is that Remark slides are naively inlined like
any other page, which -- because the Markdown is deliberately not being
rendered by ikiwiki -- results in the slide source being displayed (and
not elegantly). Clicking through to the slides works right, of course.

Should [[inline]] (and more generally [[ikiwiki/PageSpec]]) understand
that web slides are not exactly regular pages? And/or should this plugin
detect when slides are being inlined and allow ikiwiki to process the
Markdown as a sort of "preview"? --[[schmonz]]

## Concern: safety of web-editing <a id="editing"></a>

Even though `remarkpage.tmpl` has no action links, is it still possible
for someone to trick their way into web-editing a slide deck? And if
they do, is that dangerous? --[[schmonz]]
