Ah, this is something I've been meaning to look into adding for a while.

I think it might be a good idea to make the page that configures the
shortcuts be a regular page in the wiki, as was done with the smilies
plugin. Of course, it would need to avoid abuse since anyone could edit it
then (unless it were locked).

The other thing that I wondered as I looked at this is, why add a new
syntax for the shortcuts? It would be less complex, and probably easier to
implement if it used an existing syntax. The shortcuts could just use a
preprocessor directive:

	\[[shortcut dbug 30303]]

If that's not short enough, it would be possible to register a preprocessor
directive per shortcut, yeilding this syntax:

	\[[dbug 30303]]

Unless I'm missing something and a "walf expression" is something already
standard across wikis, this approach seems cleaner and easier to learn for
ikiwiki users.
