[[!template id=plugin name=sourcehighlight core=0 author="[[DavidBremner]]"]]

I noticed several places in the wiki talking about similar ideas, so I decided to put a page here to point to what I am working on.

I have implemented a simple wrapper around
 [source-highlight](http://www.gnu.org/software/src-highlite/).  You can find the latest version in 
[git](http://pivot.cs.unb.ca/git?p=ikiplugins.git;a=blob_plain;f=IkiWiki/Plugin/sourcehighlight.pm;hb=HEAD).
You must specify `highlight_lang=>"foo,bar"` in your setup file.
where foo and bar are the (source-supported) languages you want to
highlight
### Issues

- I would like to have a link to the raw source; using will_render() and then copying the file should work. 

- the common case of foo.c and foo.h breaks
because they both generate page working/dir/foo. 
It looks to me like ikiwiki is hardcoded to strip the extension in `pagename()` (IkiWiki.pm).
This problem with sourcehighlight needs to be fixed before it is very useful.

- Is there a way to configure the colors used by source-highlight (other than editing the globally installed "default.style" file)? It would help if I could pass the command arbitrary command-line arguments; then I could configure which config file it's supposed to use. For instance, I'm not a fan of hard-coding the colors into the HTML output. IMHO, css-style formatting should be preferred. All that can be set via the command line ... --Peter
