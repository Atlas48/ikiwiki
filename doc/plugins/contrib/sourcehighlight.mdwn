I noticed several places in the wiki talking about similar ideas, so I decided to put a page here to point to what I am working on.

I have copied otl.pm and am wrapping source-highlight (why this instead of vim highlight, I dunno, I must be a real emacs guy).  You can find more or less the latest 
version on 
[my wiki](http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/wiki/software/sourcehighlight.pm)

you must specify a highlight_lang=>"foo,bar" in your setup file.
where foo and bar are the (source-supported) languages you want to
highlight
# Issues

- I would like to have a link to the raw source; I'm not quite sure how to manage this at them moment.  

- the common case of foo.c and foo.h breaks
because they both generate page working/dir/foo. Is there some way to change the default output name?
