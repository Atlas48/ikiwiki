I noticed several places in the wiki talking about similar ideas, so I decided to put a page here to point to what I am working on.

I have copied otl.pm and am wrapping source-highlight (why this instead of vim highlight, I dunno, I must be a real emacs guy).  You can find more or less the latest 
version on 
[my wiki](http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/wiki/software/sourcehighlight.pm)

In the tradition of publish early and often, this just supports java 
at the moment. I will add more languages soon.
You can (and I will) add more languages by cutting and pasting the hook line.
