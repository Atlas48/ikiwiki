I can't seem to make this work. I have tried, in this [sandbox](http://mesh.openisp.ca/sandbox), to set values for fields and then display them with the getfield meta syntax, but it doesn't seem to be working.

The getfield, field and ymlfront plugins are enabled. I have tried with and without the following field registration:

    # field plugin
    # define the fields for the meshmtl project
    field_register:
    - meta
    - hostname
    - MAC
    - IP

I have tried both the ymlfront directive and the YAML markup (with the
`---` delimiter), no luck. Any idea what I am doing wrong? --

> I'm afraid I can't tell from here what the problem could be.  It's clear that ymlfront is turned on, or the ymlfront directive in your sandbox page wouldn't be processed.  The only thing I can suggest, in order to get more information about what could be going wrong, would be to do a dump of your indexdb file (see [[tips/inside dot ikiwiki]]) and see what the data for your sandbox page is.  If there is field data there, that would indicate a problem with getfield; if there isn't field data there, that would indicate a problem with field or ymlfront.

> Oh, and you only need to register "meta" with field_register; that will enable the data defined by the "meta" plugin to be read by field.  Unless "hostname", "MAC" and "IP" are plugins, you don't need to add them to field_register.  They can be taken care of by the ymlfront plugin.  Perhaps that is the problem?
