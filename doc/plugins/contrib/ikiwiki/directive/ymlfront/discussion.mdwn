I can't seem to make this work. I have tried, in this [sandbox](http://mesh.openisp.ca/sandbox), to set values for fields and then display them with the getfield meta syntax, but it doesn't seem to be working.

The getfield, field and ymlfront plugins are enabled. I have tried with and without the following field registration:

    # field plugin
    # define the fields for the meshmtl project
    field_register:
    - meta
    - hostname
    - MAC
    - IP

I have tried both the ymlfront directive and the YAML markup (with the
`---` delimiter), no luck. Any idea what I am doing wrong? --
