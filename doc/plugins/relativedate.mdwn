This plugin lets dates be displayed in relative form. Examples: "2 days ago", 
"1 month and 3 days ago", "30 minutes ago". Hovering over the date will
cause a tooltip to pop up with the absolute date.

This only works in browsers with javascript enabled; other browsers will
show the absolute date instead. Also, this plugin can be used with other
plugins like [[prettydate]] that change how the absolute date is displayed.

If this plugin is enabled, you may also add relative dates to pages in the
wiki, by using html elements in the "relativedate" class. For example, this
will display as a relative date:

	<span class="relativedate">Tue Jan 20 12:00:00 EDT 2009</span>
