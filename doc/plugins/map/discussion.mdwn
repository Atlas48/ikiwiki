I'm wanting a [[map]] (with indentation levels) showing page _titles_ instead of page 'names'.  As far as I can see, this is not an option with existing plugins - I can get a list of pages using [[inline]] and an appropriate template, but that has no indentation and therefore doesn't show structure well.

The quick way is to modify the map plugin to have a 'titles' option.  The hard way is to modify inline to have an indentation option, in which case inline will be a superset of map functionality.  The second option seems a little wrong from the point of view of perversely extending what 'inline' means, but it seems right from the point of view of combining common features.  Maybe adding template support to map is a more useful approach than just adding a title option.

Thoughts, anyone?  --[[KarlMW]]
