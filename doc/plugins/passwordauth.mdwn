[[tag type/auth]]

This plugin lets ikiwiki prompt for a user name and password when logging
into the wiki. It also handles registering users, mailing passwords, and
changing passwords in the prefs page.

It is enabled by default, but can be turned off if you want to only use
some other form of authentication, such as [[httpauth]] or [[openid]].

When the *account\_creation\_password* configuration option is enabled with
a pass-phrase, this plugin supports an "account creation password" as a
simplistic anti-spam measure.
(Some wikis edited by a particular group use an account creation password
as an "ask an existing member to get an account" system.)
