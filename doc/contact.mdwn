The ikiwiki project strongly encourages collaboration through ikiwiki itself,
and thus does not have a mailing list.  Anyone can create an account on
ikiwiki's own wiki. ikiwiki provides a [[bug_tracker|bugs]], a
[[TODO_list|TODO]], and "discussion" sub-pages for every page. ikiwiki
developers monitor RecentChanges closely, via the webpage, email,
[CIA](http://cia.navi.cx), and IRC, and respond in a timely fashion.

You could also drop by the IRC channel `#ikiwiki` on
[OFTC](http://www.oftc.net/) (`irc.oftc.net`).

... does not having a mailing list really encourage people to "collaborate through ikiwiki itself"?  Personally, I strongly prefer to participate in mailing lists via my mail/nntp client.  I follow over 50 mailing lists, so if I can't participate in a mailing list mail or nntp, I'll probably just not participate at all.  I suspect there are others in my situation.  I think that by not having an SMTP-driven mailing list, ikiwiki is passing up a big opportunity to build community. -- AdamMegacz
