The ikiwiki project strongly encourages collaboration through ikiwiki itself,
and thus does not have a mailing list.  Anyone can create an account on
ikiwiki's own wiki. ikiwiki provides a [[bug_tracker|bugs]], a
[[TODO_list|TODO]], and "discussion" sub-pages for every page. ikiwiki
developers monitor RecentChanges closely, via the webpage, email, and
[CIA](http://cia.navi.cx), and respond in a timely fashion.

You could also drop by the IRC channel `#ikiwiki` on OFTC (`irc.oftc.net`).
