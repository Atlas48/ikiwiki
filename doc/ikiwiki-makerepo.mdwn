# NAME

ikiwiki-makerepo - check an ikiwiki srcdir into revision control

# SYNOPSIS

ikiwiki-makerepo svn|git|monotone srcdir repository

ikiwiki-makerepo mercurial srcdir

# DESCRIPTION

`ikiwiki-makerepo` injects a `srcdir` directory, containing an ikiwiki wiki,
into a `repository` that it creates. The repository can be a svn, git, or
mercurial repository.

Note that for mercurial, the srcdir is converted into a mercurial
repository. There is no need to have a separate repository with mercurial.

Note that for monotone, you are assumed to already have run "mtn genkey" to generate
key.
