# DESCRIPTION

`ikiwiki-makerepo` injects a `srcdir` directory, containing an ikiwiki wiki,
into a `repository` that it creates. The repository can be a svn, git, or
mercurial repository.

Note that for mercurial, the srcdir is converted into a mercurial
repository. There is no need to have a separate repository with mercurial.
