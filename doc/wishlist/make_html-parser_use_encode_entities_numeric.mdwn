Hi,

Using encode_entities makes this sort of thing happen:

XML Parsing Error: undefined entity
Location: http://XXX.YYY.ZZZ/

and points to the relevant entity.

I think using encode_entities_numeric would help a lot with this. This is just a na√Øve assessment, but this would prevent xml-like pages being non-xml.
