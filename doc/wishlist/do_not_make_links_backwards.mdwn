I understand this may be a bit provocative, but I strongly feel that ikiwiki linking rules are backwards. I come from the world of wikis like MoinMoin and [[plugins/contrib/mediawiki]], where you use `\[[link|description]]`. The defacto wiki markup "[[plugins/creole]]" also uses that convention, as does raw HTML (href comes first!). Ikiwiki doesn't: here we need to use `\[[description|link]]`.

Everytime i come back to ikiwiki, i need to bend my mind backwards to create *proper* links. I understand that `\[[description|link]]` is more inline with Markdown's `[description](link)` approach, but in my mind it is too much of a problem for third part plugins to be a proper justification. For example, the [[plugins/creole]] plugin works pretty much as expected *expect* for links, because it can't override ikiwiki's internal link parser. For me that's a huge inconsistency that should be fixed.

If there is an agreement within the community that we can change that, I am ready to work on a migration script or even a configuration variable... -- [[anarcat]]
