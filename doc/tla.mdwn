[tla](http://wiki.gnuarch.org/) is an implementation of the [GNU](http://www.gnu.org/) [Arch](http://www.gnuarch.org/) revision control system. While ikiwiki is relatively
independent of the underlying revision control system, and can easily be
used without one, using it with Subversion is recommended since it's how
the author uses it. ([[Git]] is another option.)

Ikiwiki can run as a [[post-commit]] hook to update a wiki whenever commits
come in. When running as a [[cgi]] with tla, ikiwiki automatically
commits edited pages to the Arch repostory, and uses the Arch
log to generate the [[RecentChanges]] page.
