The ikiwiki logo *reflects* ikiwiki turning the regular wiki concept 
on its head by being a wiki compiler. Or maybe just the fact that "ikiwiki"
is an anagram. 

Anyway, if you have this logo in other fonts or colors, feel free to send
it to [[Joey]] for inclusion here. (Or upload it, once that feature is
added).
