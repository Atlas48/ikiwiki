The ikiwiki logo *reflects* ikiwiki turning the regular wiki concept 
on its head by being a wiki compiler. Or maybe just the fact that "ikiwiki"
is an anagram. 

Anyway, if you have this logo in other fonts or colors, feel free to send
it to [[Joey]] for inclusion here. (Or upload it, once that feature is
added).

  [[SVG_source|ikiwiki.svgz]], can be used to generate a logo at any size
  with a command like:  

	inkscape -w 90 -i logo -e ikiwiki.png ikiwiki.svgz

  The [[favicon.ico]] can also be generated from this file, as follows:

	inkscape -w 16 -i favicon -e favicon.ico ikiwiki.svgz

  The button can also be generated as follows:

  	inkscape -w 80 -i button -e ikiwiki_button.png ikiwiki.svgz

  Some other alternate icons and buttons are also included in the svg file
  and can be extracted by specifying their names.
