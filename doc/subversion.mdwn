Subversion is a revision control system. While ikiwiki is relatively
independant of the underlying revision control system, and can easily be
used without one, using it with Subversion is recommended since it's how
the author uses it.

Ikiwiki can run as a [[post-commit]] hook to update a wiki whenever commits
come in. When running as a [[cgi]] with Subversion, ikiwiki automatically
commits edited pages to the subversion repostory, and uses the Subversion
log to generate the [[RecentChanges]] page.
