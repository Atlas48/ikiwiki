This plugin is inspired by the calendar plugin for Blosxom, but derivesno code from it. This plugin is essentially a fancy front end to archives of previous pages, usually used for blogs. It can produce a calendar for a given month, or a list of months for a given year. To invoke the calendar, just use the preprocessor directive:

     \[[calendar ]]

or

      \[[calendar type="month" pages="blog/* and !*/Discussion"]]

or

       \[[calendar type="year"  year="2005" pages="blog/* and !*/Discussion"]]


The year and month entities in the out put have links to archive index pages, which are supposed to exist already. The idea is to create an archives hierarchy, rooted in the subdirectory specified in the site-wide customization variable, archivebase. archivebase defaults to "archives".  Links are created to pages "$archivebase/$year" and "$archivebase/$year/$month". The idea is to create annual and monthly indices, for example, by using something like this sample from my archives/2006/01.mdwn 

          \[[meta title="Archives for 2006/01"]]
          \[[inline rootpage="blog" atom="no" rss="no" show="0" pages="blog/* and !*/Discussion and creation_year(2006) and creation_month(01)" ]]

I'll send in the patch via email.
