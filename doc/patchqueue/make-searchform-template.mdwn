Here is a small patch that adds a new template for the search form. 

http://jameswestby.net/scratch/search_template.diff

I wanted this so I could add a label to it easily.

I don't really think there's a problem with doing it except that it makes it
more easy to break the search box.

	Thanks for the patch. The only problem I see is that the template
	is identical but gets rebuilt per-page. Would probably be better to
	build it only the first time, then reuse the rendered text for all
	further pages, to avoid slowing ikiwiki down any. --[[Joey]]
