This lets the site administrator have a `.htaccess` file in their underlay
directory, say, then get it copied over when the wiki is built. Without
this, installations that are located at the root of a domain don't get the
benefit of `.htaccess` such as improved directory listings, IP blocking,
URL rewriting, authorisation, etc.
