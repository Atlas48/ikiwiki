Any chance of this, or something like this, making it into the trunk?

I realized that when writing Perl modules, having a Foo.pm, and then Foo/Bar.pm is the norm, 
so maybe that's why Ikiwiki does things this way. But I still think it's "more natural" 
in a web environment. (And Python, which is where I do my hacking, imports Foo/__init__.py
if you import Foo.)

+1 for this patch making it into trunk. --James
