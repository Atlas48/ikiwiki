Any chance of this, or something like this, making it into the trunk?

I realized that when writing Perl modules, having a Foo.pm, and then Foo/Bar.pm is the norm, 
so maybe that's why Ikiwiki does things this way. But I still think it's "more natural" 
in a web environment. (And Python, which is where I do my hacking, imports Foo/__init__.py
if you import Foo.)

+1 for this patch making it into trunk. --James

While we're still testing this patch, what about creating a branch in the Ikiwiki SVN and applying the current patch? That'll make it easier to submit further patches that rely on the original. It will also allow us to experient without breaking the trunk. -- [[Ben]]
