Ikiwiki is [[FreeSoftware]], but you're also free to show your appreciation
to [[Joey]] or help offset hosting costs with a donation in any amount you
choose.

I'm also currently collecting money to register a better domain name for
ikiwiki. While ikiwiki.net seems to already be parked, some others are
available. I'd like to get at least enough to register it for 5 years
upfront (30 euros).

If you would like your donation listed here, let [[Joey]] know. Thanks to
the following people for their kind contributions:
