How do you provide the per post discussion links in your own blog?

And do you have any ideas/hints about implementing a "comments" feature.
What I'm after is something for users who don't quite understand the Wiki
style for discussions.  I would like to have a form for them to post a
comment and have the comment appended to the discussion Wiki-style.  Maybe
take it as far as implementing "replies" to other comments.
