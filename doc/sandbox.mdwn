### Let's try some Hairy Navigation [top]

* [section1][]
* [section2][]
* [section3][]

\- ndashes you say  
-- mdashes you also say  
--- whatever the even longer ones are called, you say

how's about a link to the [BBC] and to [wikipedia] with the URLs separate from the text. That looks a lot neater, in my [book]. 

Incidentally, my book is called *"The Bumper Book of Anal Gland Pus"*, so it is.

[BBC]:http://bbc.co.uk
[wikipedia]: http://wikipedia.org
[book]: http://amazon.co.uk


Now to try a pure mingin' table:

Do footnotes automatically number then?[^footnote-footnote]


|             |          Grouping           ||
First Header  | Second Header | Third Header |
 ------------ | :-----------: | -----------: |
Content       |          *Long Cell*        ||
Content       |   **Cell**    |         Cell |

New section   |     More      |         Data |
And more      |            And more          |
[Prototype table]

| Why can I not do a table? ||
| Reason | Likelihood |
------ | ------: |
you're shit | medium |
markdown is shit | low |
tables are shit | high |
something to do with the linebreaks | none |

new section | why not? |
| Spannage ||

Here is some text containing a second footnote.[^footnote-nuvver]


How's about the anal ballbaggery that is referencing. Especially that of the Harvardonian persuasion?

*"...Well, I think that Professor Dullard McTreacle is quite possibly the most tedious man in the whole Universe. My books are much more interesting and I have reliable reports that some people have managed to stay awake 'til the end of the first page, while reading them..."* [PGCE-land, 2006][#Dullard:2006].





## The first section [section1]

This is a fine section with a lot going for it. In fact, for a lot of people, this is the *section du jour*. The great Norman Pustule himself described this section as smelling like *"The Bovril of Thespes, decanted through the gussets of Joan of Arc"*

## The second section [section2]

Not many people expected the second section to measure up to the elegance of the first and, in this, they were not disappointed. Where the first section had verve and drive and an almost cavalier attitude to the English language, the second sectioned confined itself to positing the end of life in The Universe itself. A much more modest venture.

Maths?  Surely not....

<< e^(i pi) + 1 = 0 [Euler's identity]>>

<< x_(1,2) = (-b+-sqrt(b^2-4ac))/(2a) [quadratic equation solution]>>

You can also include formulas within a sentence, such as
<<x^2 + y^2 = 1>>.  You can then make a reference to
[Euler's identity].


## The third section [section3]

*"And what of the third section?"* you ask. Well, coming hard on the heels of the award-winning first and second sections, the third section had a lot to live up to. So it was no surprise to most people that it fell flat on its stupid looking face. The third section smelled of eggs, pifgas and a myriad of other noxious odours. It reeked, ponged and whiffed, in equal measure and --what's worse-- it never washed its nets!

Well, folks. That's the end of the document. Hope you liked it. Be sure to tune in again next week, when I outline the basic principles of the game of *Count Yer Nose*, which has been a firm family favourite for three hundred and seventeen years.
