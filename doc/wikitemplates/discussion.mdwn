## Place for local templates
Where does one put any locally modified templates for an individual ikiwiki? --Ivan Z.

Thank you for your response! My question arose out of my intention to make custom templates for a wiki--specifically suited for the kind of  content it will have--so, that would mean I would want to distribute them through git together with other content of the wiki. So, for this case the separation of conceptually ONE thing (the content, the templates, and the config option which orders to use these templates) into THREE separate files/repos (the main content repo, the repo with templates, and the config file) is not convenient: instead of distributing a single repo, I have to tell people to take three things if they want to replicate this wiki. How would you solve this inconvenience? Perhaps, a default location of the templates *inside* the source repo would do?--Ivan Z.
