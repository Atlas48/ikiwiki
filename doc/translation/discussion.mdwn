I have a few questions about translating PO file:

1. Assume I copied `ikiwiki.pot` file to `pl.po` file and translated it
from English to Polish. How can I check that my `pl.po` file works good?
I have some experience with building Debian packages, but I don't know
too much about working with PO files in Debian packages.

  > Try putting it into the po/ directory and running make and make install
  > in there, that should create the .mo and install it somewhere
  > appropriate. ikiwiki should display translated messages when building the
  > wiki (with -v).

2. I'll send you my translation when I finish it, of course. But what about
updating my PO file? Should I send it to you for every ikiwiki issue?
Maybe you should give write access to ikiwiki repository for translators
of PO files?

3. What is the best way to update my PO file when you do some changes in
`ikiwiki.pot` file? Should I translate my PO file from scratch or
can I do diff for old and new `ikiwiki.pot` file and update only differences?

  >>> I'm not a translator, so I don't really know..

  >>>> OK, I hope I handle it :)

4. What about "gettexting" button titles and link names? Do you really
think that there should be hardcoded in ikiwiki templates? --Pawel

  > I don't know, really. Recai's approach seems to show promise.

  >> BTW, why does ikiwiki number my questions wrongly (1., 1., 1., 1.,

  >>> My indentation mistake, I think. --[[Joey]]

  >>>> Now it's perfect :) Thank you very much! --Pawel
