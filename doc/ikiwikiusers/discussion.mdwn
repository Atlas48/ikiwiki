Do you think it might prove useful to categorize these sites into "personal
sites and blogs" and "project sites"?  To some extent this page exists to
promote ikiwiki and show its popularity, and those two categories contribute
to ikiwiki's popularity in different ways.  Personal sites and blogs primarily
contribute through sheer numbers ($BIGNUM personal sites and blogs use
ikiwiki), while project sites primarily contribute based on their own
notability (UK Software Patents Info uses ikiwiki; the ion site uses ikiwiki).
Burying the project sites in with the rest tends to make people less likely to
notice them and remark on their notability.  --[[JoshTriplett]]
