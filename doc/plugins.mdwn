Most of ikiwiki's [[features]] are implemented as plugins. Many of these 
plugins are included with ikiwiki.

[[pagestats pages="plugins/type/* and !plugins/type/slow"]]

There's documentation if you want to [[write]] your own plugins, or you can
install and use plugins [[contributed|contrib]] by others.

To enable plugins, use the `--plugin` switch described in
[[usage]], or the equivalent `add_plugins` line in [[ikiwiki.setup]].
Enable the [[goodstuff]] plugin to get a nice selection of plugins that
will fit most uses of ikiwiki.

Without administrator access, you can add some custom plugins by storing 
yourcustomplugin.pm in /home/user/.ikiwiki/IkiWiki/Plugins (or any other
place, keeping the "IkiWiki/Plugins" part of the path) and adding this
line at the begining of your ikiwiki.setup file:

    BEGIN { push @INC, "/home/user/.ikiwiki" }
