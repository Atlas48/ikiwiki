There's documentation if you want to [[write]] your own plugins, or you can install and use plugins contributed by others. 

The ikiwiki package includes some standard plugins that are installed and
by default. These include [[inline]], [[pagecount]], and [[brokenlinks]], and [[search]]. Of these, [[inline]] is enabled by default.

To enable other plugins, use the `--plugin` switch described in [[usage]],
or the equivalent line in [[ikiwiki.setup]].

## Plugin directory

Add your contributed plugins here. Or add ideas to the [[todo|todo/plugin]] page.

[[inline pages="plugins/* !plugins/write !*/Discussion" archive="yes" rootpage="plugins/contrib" show="30"]]

## Installing third party plugins

Plugins are perl modules and should be installed somewhere in the perl
module search path. See the @INC list at the end of the output of `perl -V`
for a list of the directories in that path. All plugins are in the
IkiWiki::Plugin namespace, so they go in a IkiWiki/Plugin subdirectory
inside the perl search path. For example, if your perl looks in
`/usr/local/lib/site_perl` for modules, you can locally install ikiwiki
plugins to `/usr/local/lib/site_perl/IkiWiki/Plugin`
