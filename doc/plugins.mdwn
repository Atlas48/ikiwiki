Most of ikiwiki's [[features]] are implemented as plugins. Beyond the
[[type/core]] features, there are plugins to [[type/format]] text,
use [[type/tags]], show [[type/meta]] information, do other [[type/useful]]
stuff, add [[type/chrome]] to the wiki, or just have [[type/fun]].

There's documentation if you want to [[write]] your own plugins, or you can
install and use plugins contributed by others. 

The [[mdwn]], [[inline]], and [[htmlscrubber]] plugins are enabled by default.

To enable other plugins, use the `--plugin` switch described in [[usage]],
or the equivalent `add_plugins` line in [[ikiwiki.setup]].

# Plugin directory

Add all plugins here. Or add ideas to the [[todo|todo/plugin]] page.

# Installing third party plugins

Plugins are perl modules and should be installed somewhere in the perl
module search path. See the @INC list at the end of the output of `perl -V`
for a list of the directories in that path. All plugins are in the
IkiWiki::Plugin namespace, so they go in a IkiWiki/Plugin subdirectory
inside the perl search path. For example, if your perl looks in
`/usr/local/lib/site_perl` for modules, you can locally install ikiwiki
plugins to `/usr/local/lib/site_perl/IkiWiki/Plugin`
