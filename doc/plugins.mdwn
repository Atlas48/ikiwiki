Most of ikiwiki's [[features]] are implemented as plugins. Beyond the
[[type/core]] features, there are plugins to [[type/format]] text,
use [[type/tags]], show [[type/meta]] information, add [[type/auth]]
methods, do other [[type/useful]] stuff, add [[type/chrome]] to the
wiki, or just have [[type/fun]].

There's documentation if you want to [[write]] your own plugins, or you can
install and use plugins [[contributed|contrib]] by others.

To enable plugins, use the `--plugin` switch described in
[[usage]], or the equivalent `add_plugins` line in [[ikiwiki.setup]].
Enable the [[goodstuff]] plugin to get a nice selection of plugins that
will fit most uses of ikiwiki.
