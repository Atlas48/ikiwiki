In order to refer to a branch in one of the [[git]] repositories, for
example when submitting a [[patch]], you can use the
[[templates/gitbranch]] template.

Branches referred to in open [[bugs]] and [[todo]]:

[[!inline pages="(todo/* or bugs/*) and link(/branches) and !link(bugs/done)
and !link(todo/done) and !*/*/*" show=0 archive=yes]]

The main ikiwiki git repository has some branches included in it, too:

* `gallery` contains the [[todo/Gallery]] plugin. It's not yet merged
  due to license issues.  Also some bits need to be tweaked to make it
  work with the current *master* branch again.
* `wikiwyg` adds [[todo/wikiwyg]] support. It is unmerged pending some
  changes.
* `debian-stable` is used for updates to the old version included in
  Debian's stable release, and `debian-testing` is used for updates to
  Debian's testing release. (These and similar branches will be rebased.)
* `ignore` gets various branches merged to it that [[Joey]] wishes to ignore
  when looking at everyone's unmerged changes.
* `pristine-tar` contains deltas that
  [pristine-tar](http://kitenet.net/~joey/code/pristine-tar)
  can use to recreate released tarballs of ikiwiki
