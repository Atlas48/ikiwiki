While ikiwiki supports hierarchically categorising pages by creating
[[SubPage]]s, that's often not flexible enough, and it can also be useful
to tag pages in various non-hierarchical ways.

Since this is a wiki, tagging is just a form of linking. For example, since
this page links to [[features]], it can be considered to have something to
do with ikiwiki's features. If you want to put pages into a category, the
typical wiki way to do so is to create a "CategoryFoo" page and link pages
in the category to it. That is just another form of tagging.

Sometimes you may want to tag a page without putting a visible link on it.
The [[tag_plugin|plugins/tag]] allows you to do so, like this:

	\[[tag mytag othertag thirdtag]]

One way to use these tags is to create a [[blog]] of pages that have a
particular set of tags. Or just look at the [[BackLinks]] to a tag page to
see all the pages that are tagged with it. [[Plugins]] can be written to do
anything else with tags that you might desire.
