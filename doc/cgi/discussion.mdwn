## Markdown or CGI error prevents web-based editing 

I have a working ikiwiki configuration with an SVN backend, running on Ubuntu 7.10, Apache 2.2.4. I'm using Perl 5.8.8, however, I had to use Text::Markdown 1.0.5 from CPAN instead of the latest because I had the same issue as someone [here](http://ikiwiki.info/index/discussion/) (Namely I was getting this error until I used the old Markdown version: "*** glibc detected *** double free or corruption (!prev): 0x0922e478 ***
"). 

CGI seems to be working at least partly - the History and Recent Changes pages both work. However, if I attempt to edit or create a page, I get this error:
    Error: Failed to load plugin IkiWiki::Plugin::mdwn: Can't locate IkiWiki/Plugin/mdwn.pm in @INC (@INC contains: /etc/perl /usr/local/lib/perl/5.8.8 /usr/local/share/perl/5.8.8 /usr/lib/perl5 /usr/share/perl5 /usr/lib/perl/5.8 /usr/share/perl/5.8 /usr/local/lib/site_perl .) at (eval 6) line 2. BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at (eval 6) line 2. 

Since ikiwiki builds, it has to be finding Markdown at build time, right? What am I doing wrong here? I would appreciate a point in the right direction. Thanks.  [[mrled]]
