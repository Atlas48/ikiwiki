# NAME

ikiwiki - a wiki compiler

# SYNOPSIS

ikiwiki [options] source templates destination

ikiwiki --setup configfile

# DESCRIPTION

`ikiwiki` is a wiki compiler. It builds static html pages for a wiki, from
`source` in the [[MarkDown]] language, using the specified html `templates`
and writes it out to `destination`.

# OPTIONS

Note that most options can be shortened to single letters, and boolean
flags such as --verbose can be negated with --no-verbose.

* --wikiname

  The name of the wiki, default is "wiki".

* --verbose

  Be vebose about what it's doing.

* --rebuild

  Force a rebuild of all pages.

* --wrapper [file]

  Generate a [[wrapper]] binary that is hardcoded to do action specified by
  the other options, using the specified input files and `destination`
  directory. The filename to use for the wrapper is optional.

  The wrapper is designed to be safely made suid and be run by untrusted
  users, as a [[Subversion]] [[post-commit]] hook, or as a [[CGI]].

  Note that the generated wrapper will ignore all command line parameters
  except for --params, which will make it print out the parameters it would
  run ikiwiki with.

* --wrappermode mode

  Specify a mode to chmod the wrapper to after creating it.

* --svn, --nosvn

  Enable or disable use of [[subversion]]. If subversion is enabled, the `source` directory is assumed to be a working copy, and is automatically updated before building the wiki. 

  In [[CGI]] mode, with subversion enabled pages edited via the web will be committed to subversion. Also, the [[RecentChanges]] link will be placed on pages.

  Subversion is enabled by default.

* --anonok, --noanonok

  If anonok is set, it will allow anonymous web users, who have not signed in, to make changes to the wiki.

  By default, anonymous users cannot edit the wiki.

* --cgi

  Enable [[CGI]] mode. In cgi mode ikiwiki runs as a cgi script, and supports editing pages, signing in, registration, and displaying [[RecentChanges]].

  To use ikiwiki as a [[CGI]] program you need to use --wrapper to generate a wrapper. The wrapper will generally need to run suid 6755 to the user who owns the `source` and `destination` directories.

* --url http://someurl/

  Specifies the url to the wiki. This is a required parameter in [[CGI]] mode.

* --cgiurl http://someurl/ikiwiki.cgi

  Specifies the url to the ikiwiki [[CGI]] script [[wrapper]]. Required when building the wiki for links to the cgi script to be generated.

* --historyurl http://svn.someurl/trunk/\[[file]]?root=wiki

  Specifies the url to link to for page history browsing. In the url,
  "\[[file]]" is replaced with the file to browse. It's common to use
  [[ViewCVS]] for this.

* --diffurl http://svn.someurl/trunk/\[[file]]?root=wiki&r1=\[[r1]]&r2=\[[r2]]

  Specifies the url to link to for a diff of changes to a page. In the url,
  "\[[file]]" is replaced with the file to browse, "\[[r1]]" is the old
  revision of the page, and "\[[r2]]" is the new revision. It's common to use
  [[ViewCVS]] for this.

* --exclude regexp

  Specifies a rexexp of source files to exclude from processing.
  May be specified multiple times to add to exclude list.

* --setup configfile

  In setup mode, ikiwiki reads the config file, which is really a perl
  program that can call ikiwiki internal functions. Uses of this are
  various; the normal one is to automatically generate wrappers for a
  wiki based on data in a config file.
  
  Note that the wiki will be (re)built as part of the setup process to
  ensure that any changes take effect.

  [[ikiwiki.setup]] is an example of such a config file.
