# NAME

ikiwiki - a wiki compiler

# SYNOPSIS

ikiwiki [options] source destination

ikiwiki --setup configfile

# DESCRIPTION

`ikiwiki` is a wiki compiler. It builds static html pages for a wiki, from
`source` in the [[MarkDown]] language (or others), and writes it out to
`destination`.

Note that most options can be shortened to single letters, and boolean
flags such as --verbose can be negated with --no-verbose.

# MODE OPTIONS

These options control the mode that ikiwiki is operating in.

* --refresh

  Refresh the wiki, updating any changed pages. This is the default
  behavior so you don't normally need to specify it.

* --rebuild

  Force a rebuild of all pages.

* --cgi

  Enable [[CGI]] mode. In cgi mode ikiwiki runs as a cgi script, and
  supports editing pages, signing in, registration, and displaying
  [[RecentChanges]].

  To use ikiwiki as a [[CGI]] program you need to use --wrapper or --setup
  to generate a wrapper. The wrapper will generally need to run suid 6755 to
  the user who owns the `source` and `destination` directories.

* --wrapper [file]

  Generate a wrapper binary that is hardcoded to do action specified by
  the other options, using the specified input files and `destination`
  directory. The filename to use for the wrapper is optional.

  The wrapper is designed to be safely made suid and be run by untrusted
  users, as a [[post-commit]] hook, or as a [[CGI]].

  Note that the generated wrapper will ignore all command line parameters.

* --setup configfile

  In setup mode, ikiwiki reads the config file, which is really a perl
  program that can call ikiwiki internal functions.

  The default action when --setup is specified is to automatically generate
  wrappers for a wiki based on data in a config file, and rebuild the wiki.

  [[ikiwiki.setup]] is an example of such a config file.

* --wrappers

  If used with --setup --refresh, this makes it also update any configured
  wrappers.

* --aggregate

  If the [[plugins/aggregate]] plugin is enabled, this makes ikiwiki poll
  configured feeds and save new posts to the srcdir.

  Note that to rebuild previously aggregated posts, use the --rebuild option
  along with this one. --rebuild will also force feeds to be polled even if
  they were polled recently.

* --version

  Print ikiwiki version number.

# CONFIG OPTIONS

These options configure the wiki. Note that [[plugins]] can add additional
configuration options of their own.

* --wikiname

  The name of the wiki, default is "wiki".

* --templatedir

  Specify the directory that the page [[templates]] are stored in.
  Default is `/usr/share/ikiwiki/templates`, or another location as
  configured at build time.

* --underlaydir

  Specify the directory that is used to underlay the source directory.
  Source files will be taken from here unless overridden by a file in the
  source directory. Default is `/usr/share/ikiwiki/basewiki` or another
  location as configured at build time.

* --wrappermode mode

  Specify a mode to chmod the wrapper to after creating it.

* --notify

  Enable email notification of commits. This should be used when running
  ikiwiki as a [[post-commit]] hook.

* --rcs=svn, --no-rcs

  Enable or disable use of a revision control system.

  If you use svn, the `source` directory is assumed to be
  a [[Subversion]] working copy.

  If you use git, the `source` directory is assumed to be a clone of the
  [[git]] repository.

  In [[CGI]] mode, with a revision control system enabled pages edited via
  the web will be committed. Also, the [[RecentChanges]] link will be placed
  on pages.

  svn is enabled by default.

* --svnrepo /svn/wiki

  Specify the location of the svn repository for the wiki. This is required
  for using --notify with [[subversion]].

* --svnpath trunk

  Specify the path inside your svn reporistory where the wiki is located.
  This defaults to trunk; change it if your wiki is at some other location
  inside the repository.

* --anonok, --noanonok

  If anonok is set, it will allow anonymous web users, who have not signed in, to make changes to the wiki.

  By default, anonymous users cannot edit the wiki.

* --rss, --norss

  If rss is set, ikiwiki will generate rss feeds for pages that inline
  a [[blog]].

* --pingurl url

  Set this to the url to an XML-RPC service to ping when an RSS feed is
  updated. For example, to ping Technorati, use the url
  http://rpc.technorati.com/rpc/ping

  This parameter can be specified multiple times to specify more than one
  url to ping.

* --url url

  Specifies the url to the wiki. This is a required parameter in [[CGI]] mode.

* --cgiurl http://url/ikiwiki.cgi

  Specifies the url to the ikiwiki [[CGI]] script wrapper. Required when
  building the wiki for links to the cgi script to be generated.

* --historyurl url

  Specifies the url to link to for page history browsing. In the url,
  "\[[file]]" is replaced with the file to browse. It's common to use
  [[ViewCVS]] for this.

* --adminemail you@yourhost

  Specifies the email address that ikiwiki should use for sending email.

* --diffurl url

  Specifies the url to link to for a diff of changes to a page. In the url,
  "\[[file]]" is replaced with the file to browse, "\[[r1]]" is the old
  revision of the page, and "\[[r2]]" is the new revision. It's common to use
  [[ViewCVS]] for this.

* --exclude regexp

  Specifies a rexexp of source files to exclude from processing.
  May be specified multiple times to add to exclude list.

* --adminuser name

  Specifies a username of a user who has the powers of a wiki admin.
  Currently allows locking of any page, other powers may be added later.
  May be specified multiple times for multiple admins.

* --plugin name

  Enables the use of the specified [[plugin|plugins]] in the wiki. 
  Note that plugin names are case sensative.

* --disable-plugin name

  Disables use of a plugin. For example "--disable-plugin htmlscrubber"
  to do away with html sanitization.

* --discussion, --no-discussion

  Enables or disables "Discussion" links from being added to the header of
  every page. The links are enabled by default.

* --timeformat format

  Specify how to display the time or date. The format string is passed to the
  strftime(3) function.

* --verbose, --no-verbose

  Be vebose about what is being done.

* --syslog, --no-syslog

  Log to syslog.

* --w3mmode, --no-w3mmode

  Enable [[w3mmode]], which allows w3m to use ikiwiki as a local CGI script,
  without a web server.

* --getctime

  Pull last changed time for each new page out of the revision control
  system. This rarely used option provides a way to get the real creation
  times of items in weblogs, for example when building a wiki from a new
  subversion checkout. It is unoptimised and quite slow. It is best used
  with --rebuild, to force ikiwiki to get the ctime for all pages.
