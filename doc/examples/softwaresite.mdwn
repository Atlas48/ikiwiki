This is an [[example_software_package_website|index]].
Just copy the softwaresite subdirectory into your wiki to quickly produce
a website for a piece of software.

Some additional configuration you might want to do:

* Make sure to configure ikiwiki to generate RSS or Atom feeds.

* The softwaresite/doc subdirectory is intended to hold docs about your
  software package. These docs can be included in the package itself;
  there is a [[softwaresite/Makefile]] that will use ikiwiki to build
  static html documentation. ikiwiki itself uses a similar system to build
  its documentation.
