##How to remove the postform for my blog from front page?

I have an inline to create a blog on the front page of my site. I don't want any visitors to see that form nor attempt to click "Edit" on it.  I tried setting postform="no" but I did not notice any change.

Any suggestions on how I can have a private webpage that offers the blog post form ("Add a new post titled:") and also turn off that form from my front page but still keep the blog articles displayed from the front page.

I looked at the "inline" docs but may have overlooked this.

I do see I can disable the editpage plugin to remove from front page. But then that made it so I can't add a new blog posting (I want to just not from the front page).
