Some additional configuration you might want to do:

* Change the name of the blog, by editing `index.mdwn` and changing
  the `title`.

* Make sure to configure ikiwiki to generate RSS or Atom feeds.

* Make sure you have the tag plugin enabled, and tag posts using it. An
  example of how to tag a post is:
	\[[!tag tags/life]]

* Enable the [[sidebar|plugin/sidebar]] plugin to get a sidebar listing all
  the categories you've tagged posts with.

* Enable the [[pagestats|plugin/pagestats]] plugin to get a tag cloud
* display on the [[index]].

* Enable the [[comments|plugin/comments]] plugin and configure it to
  enable comments to posts to the blog:

  	comments_pagespec => 'blog/posts/*',
