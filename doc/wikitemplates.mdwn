ikiwiki uses the HTML::Template module as its template engine. This
supports things like conditionals and loops in templates and is pretty easy
to learn.

The aim is to keep almost all html out of ikiwiki and in the templates.

It ships with some basic templates which can be customised. These are
located in /usr/share/ikiwiki/templates by default.

* `page.tmpl` - Used for displaying all regular wiki pages.
* `misc.tmpl` - Generic template used for any page that doesn't
  have a custom template.
* `recentchanges.tmpl` - Used for the RecentChanges page.
* `editpage.tmpl` - Create/edit page.
* `notifymail.tmpl` - Not a html template, this is used to
  generate change notification mails for users who have subscribed to
  changes to a page.
* `passwordmail.tmpl` - Not a html template, this is used to
  generate the mail with the user's password in it.
* `rsspage.tmpl` - Used for generating rss feeds for [[blog]]s.
* `rssitem.tmpl` - Used for generating individual items on rss feeds.
* `atompage.tmpl` - Used for generating atom feeds for [[blog]]s.
* `atomitem.tmpl` - Used for generating individual items on atom feeds.
* `inlinepage.tmpl` - Used for adding a page inline in a blog
  page.
* `archivepage.tmpl` - Used for listing a page in a blog archive page.
* `estseek.conf` - Not a html template, this is actually a template for
  a config file for the [[HyperEstraier]] search engine. If you like you
  can read the [[HyperEstraier]] docs and configure it using this.
* `blogpost.tmpl` - Used for a form to add a post to a blog (and a rss/atom links)
* `feedlink.tmpl` - Used to add rss/atom links if blogpost.tmpl is not used.
* `aggregatepost.tmpl` - Used by the [[plugins/aggregate]] plugin to create
  a page for a post.
* `searchform.tmpl` - Used by the [[plugins/search]] plugin to add a search
  form to wiki pages.

The [[plugins/pagetemplate]] plugin can allow individual pages to use a
different template than `page.tmpl`.

The [[plugins/template]] plugin also uses templates, though those
[[templates]] are stored in the wiki.
