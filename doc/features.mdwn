Currently implemented:

* [[MarkDown]]

  ikiwiki supports pages using [[MarkDown]] as their markup language. Any
  page with a filename ending in ".mdwn" is converted from markdown to html
  by ikiwiki. Markdown understands text formatted as it would be in an email,
  and is quite smart about converting it to html. The only additional markup
  provided by ikiwiki aside from regular markdown is the [[WikiLink]].

* support for other file types

  ikiwiki also supports files of any other type, including raw html, text,
  images, etc. These are not converted to wiki pages, they are just copied
  unchanged by ikiwiki as it builds your wiki. So you can check in an image,
  program, or other special file and link to it from your wiki pages.

* [[SubPage]]s

  Arbitrarily deep hierarchies of pages with fairly simple and useful [[SubPage/LinkingRUles]]
