[[!meta title="CSS Market"]]

User contributed stylesheet files for ikiwiki. Feel free to add your own
stylesheets here. (Upload as wiki pages; wiki gnomes will convert them to css
files..)

* **[[css_market/zack.css]]**, contributed by [[StefanoZacchiroli]],
  customized mostly for *blogging purposes*, can be seen in action on 
  [zack's blog](http://www.bononia.it/~zack/blog/)
  [[!meta stylesheet="zack"]]

* **[[css_market/kirkambar.css]]**, contributed by [[Roktas]].  This far from perfect
  stylesheet follows a [Gitweb](http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=git/git.git;a=tree;f=gitweb)
  like theme, so it may provide a consistent look'n feel along with the [[rcs/git]] backend. ;-)
  You can see it in action on [kirkambar](http://kirkambar.net/) (Turkish content).
  [[!meta stylesheet="kirkambar"]]

* **[[css_market/embeddedmoose.css]]**, contributed by [[JoshTriplett]].
  Designed for [Embedded Moose](http://embeddedmoose.com).  Some ideas from the
  Debian lighttpd index.html page.
  [[!meta stylesheet="embeddedmoose"]]

* **Refresh**, contributed by [[FredericLespez]]. Adapted from a free template
  designed by [styleshout](http://www.styleshout.com).
  You can see it [here](http://fred.ccheznous.org). You can download the local.css file and
  the modified templates [here](http://fred.ccheznous.org/refresh_20060602.tgz).
    * You'll find a updated version of these templates [here](http://www.der-winnie.de/~winnie/configs/ikiwiki-templates.tar.gz). 
      These templates are known to work with ikiwiki 2.31, and since I'll install always the newest one on my server I'll will update them on a regular basis.


* **[[02_Template.css]]**, contributed and adapted by [maxx](http://martin.wuertele.net/), [original](http://www.openwebdesign.org/viewdesign.phtml?id=3057)
  designed by [jarico](http://www.openwebdesign.org/userinfo.phtml?user=jcarico) 
  (License: public domain). You'll need a modified page.tmpl
  **[[css_market/02_Template.tmpl]]**. If you prefer 
  [my header image](http://martin.wuertele.net/images/header.png) you can 
  use it under the terms of the MIT License (see png comment).
  [[!meta stylesheet="02_Template"]]

* **[[css_market/cstamas.css]]**, contributed by [[cstamas]].
  This one is based on embeddedmoose, however it is slightly different now.
  [My webpage's](http://users.itk.ppke.hu/~cstamas/tag/english) is not the same.
  You can grab some pictures used as background patterns from there.
  [[!meta stylesheet="cstamas"]]

* **[[css_market/bma.css]]**, contributed by [bma](http://subvert.org.uk/~bma/).
  Not quite the same as I use on my site, since that has slightly modified
  templates.
  [[!meta stylesheet="bma"]]

If your web browser allows selecting between multiple stylesheets, this
page can be viewed using many of the stylesheets above. For example, if
using Epiphany with the Select Stylesheet extension enabled, use View ->
Style.  In Firefox or Iceweasel, use View -> Page Style.
