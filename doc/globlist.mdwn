When the wiki stores lists of pages, such as pages that are locked or pages
that you want to be emailed if changed, it uses a GlobList.

This is a list of page names, separated by white space. The "glob" bit is
that as well as full page names, it can contain glob patterns. "`*`" stands
in for any part of the page name, and "`?`" for any single letter of its
name. So if you wanted to list all the pages about tea, and any
[[SubPage]]s of the SandBox, but not including the SandBox itself:

	*tea* SandBox/*

You can also prefix an item in the list with "`!`" to skip matching any
pages that match it. So if you want to specify all pages except for
Discussion pages and the SandBox:

	* !SandBox !*/Discussion
