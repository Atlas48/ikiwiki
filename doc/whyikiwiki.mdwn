Why call it IkiWiki? Well, partly because I'm sure some people will find
this a pretty Iky Wiki, since it's so different from other Wikis. Partly
because "ikiwiki" is a nice palindrome. Partly because its design turns
the usual design for a Wiki inside-out and backwards.

Oh, maybe you wanted to know why you'd want to choose ikiwiki instead of all the other wikis out there? Unless your personal strangeness significantly aligns with [[Joey]]'s, so that keeping everything in subversion, compiling websites to static html, and like design [[features]] appeal to you, you probably won't.
