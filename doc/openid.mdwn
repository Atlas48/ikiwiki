[[meta title="OpenID"]]

[OpenID](http://openid.net) is a decentralized authentication mechanism
that allows you to have one login that you can use on a growing number of
websites.

To sign up for an OpenID, visit one of the following identity providers:

* [MyOpenID](https://www.myopenid.com/affiliate_signup?affiliate_id=26)
* [GetOpenID](https://getopenid.com/)
* [LiveJournal](http://www.livejournal.com/openid/)
* or any of the many others out there..

To sign in to this wiki using OpenID, just enter it in the OpenID field in
the signin form. (If the field does not appear, OpenID signin is
disabled.) You do not need to give this wiki a password or go through any
registration process when using OpenID.

In case you haven't worked it out yet your OpenID is the URL that you are
given when you sign up (at least for MyOpenID). I at least was expecting
some sort of number.

It's also possible to make a page in the wiki usable as an OpenID url,
by delegating it to an openid server. Here's an example of how to do that:

	\[[meta link="http://www.myopenid.com/server" rel="openid.server"]]
	\[[meta link="http://yourid.myopenid.com/" rel="openid.delegate"]]
