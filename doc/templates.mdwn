ikiwiki uses the HTML::Template module as its template engine. This supports things like conditionals and loops in templates and is pretty easy to learn.

It ships with some basic templates which can be customised:

* `templates/page.tmpl` - Used for displaying all regular wiki pages.
* `templates/recentchanges.tmpl` - Used for the RecentChanges page.
* `templates/edit.tmpl' - Edit page.
* `templates/create.tmpl' - Creating a new page.
* `templates/signin.tmpl` - Used for the SignIn form and all assciated forms, if it exists.
   
  Note that the SignIn form is implemented using CGI::FormBuilder, which interfaces to HTML::Template, so not all of it can be customised with templates, although most of it can, by creating this template. Without the template, CGI::FormBuilder creates the page by itself.

I aim to keep almost all html out of ikiwiki and in the templates.
