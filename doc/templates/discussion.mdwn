I was wondering what the best way to customise the templates is.

Would it be best to copy them all into the wiki under version control or have them seperate?

Thanks

> Either way would work ok. From a security standpoint, keeping the templates under version control isn't entirely safe, if you have anonymous untrusted svn committers. Web commits won't be able to touch them though, so that's ok. --[[Joey]]


Couldn't the [[templates/plugin]] template replace the "included" parameter
with the same check used for "third-party plugin"?  Don't "third-party plugin"
and "included in ikiwiki" form precisely complementary sets?  --[[JoshTriplett]]
