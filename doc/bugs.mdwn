* Has bugs updating things if the bestlink of a page changes due to
  adding/removing a page. For example, if Foo/Bar links to "Baz", which is
  Foo/Baz, and Foo/Bar/Baz gets added, it will update the links in Foo/Bar
  to point to it, but will forget to update the linkbacks in Foo/Baz.
  And if Foo/Bar/Baz is then removed, it forgets to update Foo/Bar to link
  back to Foo/Baz.

    -- is this still true?

* If I try to do a web commit, to a svn+ssh repo, it fails with
  "Host key verification failed."
  I think that the setuid isn't fully taking; it should be running as me,
  but commit log shows www-data. So maybe it has the wrong username? Or
  EUID/Real UID screwage.
* Can't put the source in a directory named .source; the page finder skips
  that due to too broad exclusion of any dotfile in a path.
* RecentChanges is a regular page, perhaps it should be automatically
  replaced with a link to the [[CGI]]?
* [[ikiwiki]] should go to the same place as [[index]] (on this wiki).
* Web browsers don't word-wrap lines in submitted text, which makes editing a
  page that someone wrote in a web browser annoying (`gqip` is vim user's
  friend here). Is there any way to improve this?
* The diff links in RecentChanges go to a viewcvs backtrace if the rev in question is when the page was added. Is this a viewcvs bug, or a behavior ikiwiki needs to work around?
    - As a special case, there should certianly be no history link for
      pages generated from the underlaydir as it can never work for them.
* If a page stops inlining anthing, its rss feed file
  will linger around and not be deleted.
* Currently only one blog is supported per page. Attempts to add more
  will make it only update one of the blogs on the page.
* RSS output contains relative links. Ie. http://kitenet.net/~joey/blog/index.rss contains a link to http://kitenet.net/~joey/blog/../blog.html
* If a file in the srcdir is removed, exposing a file in the underlaydir,
  ikiwiki will not notice the change and rebuild it until the file in the
  underlaydir gets a mtime newer than the mtime the removed file had.
* ikiwiki will generate html formatted error messages to the command
  line if --cgi is set, even if it's not yet running as a cgi
* if a page containing an rss feed happens to show up in an rss feed,
  the preprocessor directives won't be expanded (good) but are left in
  raw rather than removed (bad)
