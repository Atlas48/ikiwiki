* Has bugs updating things if the bestlink of a page changes due to
  adding/removing a page. For example, if Foo/Bar links to "Baz", which is
  Foo/Baz, and Foo/Bar/Baz gets added, it will update the links in Foo/Bar
  to point to it, but will forget to update the linkbacks in Foo/Baz.
  And if Foo/Bar/Baz is then removed, it forgets to update Foo/Bar to link
  back to Foo/Baz.
* Foo/Bar/Baz shows up as Bar/Baz in the linkbacks on page Foo/Bar. Should
  show as just Baz there.
* If I try to do a web commit, to a svn+ssh repo, it fails with
  "Host key verification failed."
  I think that the setuid isn't fully taking; it should be running as me,
  but commit log shows www-data. So maybe it has the wrong username?
