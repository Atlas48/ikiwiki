* Has bugs updating things if the bestlink of a page changes due to
  adding/removing a page. For example, if Foo/Bar links to "Baz", which is
  Foo/Baz, and Foo/Bar/Baz gets added, it will update the links in Foo/Bar
  to point to it, but will forget to update the linkbacks in Foo/Baz.
  And if Foo/Bar/Baz is then removed, it forgets to update Foo/Bar to link
  back to Foo/Baz.

    -- is this still true?

* If I try to do a web commit, to a svn+ssh repo, it fails with
  "Host key verification failed."
  I think that the setuid isn't fully taking; it should be running as me,
  but commit log shows www-data. So maybe it has the wrong username? Or
  EUID/Real UID screwage.
* Can't put the source in a directory named .source; the page finder skips
  that due to too broad exclusion of any dotfile in a path.
* RecentChanges is a regular page, perhaps it should be automatically
  replaced with a link to the [[CGI]]?
* [[ikiwiki]] should go to the same place as [[index]] (on this wiki).
* Web browsers don't word-wrap lines in submitted text, which makes editing a
  page that someone wrote in a web browser annoying (`gqip` is vim user's
  friend here). Is there any way to improve this?
* The diff links in RecentChanges go to a viewcvs backtrace if the rev in question is when the page was added. Is this a viewcvs bug, or a behavior ikiwiki needs to work around?
* If a page stops inlining anthing, its rss feed file
  will linger around and not be deleted.
* Currently only one blog is supported per page. Attempts to add more
  will make it only update one of the blogs on the page.
* If I edit blog/entry/blog_moved, add a link to code/ikiwiki, and hit
  preview, it doesn't get the link right because it makes it relative to
  where the page will be saved to, not to where the cgi script is.
* RSS output contains relative links. Ie. http://kitenet.net/~joey/blog/index.rss contains a link to http://kitenet.net/~joey/blog/../blog.html
