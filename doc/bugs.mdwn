* Has bugs updating things if the bestlink of a page changes due to
  adding/removing a page. For example, if Foo/Bar links to "Baz", which is
  Foo/Baz, and Foo/Bar/Baz gets added, it will update the links in Foo/Bar
  to point to it, but will forget to update the linkbacks in Foo/Baz.
  And if Foo/Bar/Baz is then removed, it forgets to update Foo/Bar to link
  back to Foo/Baz.
* If I try to do a web commit, to a svn+ssh repo, it fails with
  "Host key verification failed."
  I think that the setuid isn't fully taking; it should be running as me,
  but commit log shows www-data. So maybe it has the wrong username? Or
  EUID/Real UID screwage.
* Can't put the source in a directory named .source; the page finder skips
  that due to too broad exclusion of any dotfile in a path.
* RecentChanges is a regular page, perhaps it should be automatically
  replaced with a link to the [[CGI]]?
* [[ikiwiki]] should go to the same place as [[index]] (on this wiki).
* Doesn't update pages that linked to a page when it is removed.
