# Creating an anchor in Markdown

Is it a native Markdown "tag" for creating an anchor? Unfortunately,
I haven't any information about it at
[Markdown syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) page.

Of course, I know that I can use HTML tag to do it,
for example &lt;a name="foo" /&gt;, but I don't want to mix Markdown
and HTML code if it's not necessary.

BTW, ikiwiki doesn't displays the #foo anchor in the example
("To link to an anchor inside a page...") at [[WikiLink]] page...
