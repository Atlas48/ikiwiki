The ikiwiki project strongly encourages collaboration through ikiwiki itself,
and thus does not have a mailing list.  Anyone can create an account on
ikiwiki's own wiki.  ikiwiki provides a [[bug_tracker|bugs]], a
[[TODO_list|TODO]], and the ability to create a [[weblog|blog]] on any page.
ikiwiki also includes "discussion" sub-pages on every page.  ikiwiki
developers monitor RecentChanges closely, via the webpage, email, and
[CIA](http://cia.navi.cx), and respond in a timely fashion.
