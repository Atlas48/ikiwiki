I am using ikiwiki 2.6.1.

I can't figure out the locked pages.

As an admin in preferences, I put in my Locked Pages:

index and downloads

I don't want anyone to be able to edit the front page or my downloads page.

That didn't work. I am using a different web browser as a different non-ikiwiki-admin user.

So I changed it to

/index and /downloads

That stopped me from editing the front page. It didn't say it was locked just repeatedly gave me the ikiwiki login. (How can I get it to tell me it is locked instead?)

I also tried

/index and /downloads/index

But I could still edit my downloads page.

Can someone share some hints on how to lock these two pages?

My source pages for the lock are:

source/downloads.mdwn
source/index.mdwn

My webpages to lock are:

public\_html/downloads/index.html
public\_html/index.html

> To me saying "lock both 'index and downloads'" made sense while now it reads like: "lock either 'index or downloads'". Maybe the [[PageSpec]] should define "and" and "or" (beyond the examples it has).
