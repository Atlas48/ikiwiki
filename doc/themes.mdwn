Ikiwiki now comes with several themes contributed by users.
You can enable the [[theme_plugin|plugins/theme]] to use any of these.

A theme provides, via the underlay, an enhanced version of the regular
[[style.css]]. This leaves [[local.css]] free for you to further
customise. Themes can also provide header and background images.

[[!img align=left actiontabs_small.png]] The actiontabs theme, contributed by
[[svend]]. This style sheet displays the action list
(Edit, RecentChanges, etc.) as tabs.

[[!img align=left blueview_small.png]] The blueview theme, contributed by
[[BerndZeimetz]], featuring a panorama photo he took.

[[!img align=left none_small.png]] For completeness, ikiwiki's default
anti-theme.
