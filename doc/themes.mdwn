A theme provides, via the underlay, an enhanced version of the regular
[[style.css]]. This leaves [[local.css]] free for you to further
customise. Themes can also provide header and background images.

Ikiwiki now comes with several themes contributed by users.
You can enable the [[theme_plugin|plugins/theme]] to use any of these:

[[!img actiontabs_small.png align=left]] The actiontabs theme, contributed by
[[svend]]. This style sheet displays the action list
(Edit, RecentChanges, etc.) as tabs.

<br clear="both" />

[[!img blueview_small.png align=left]] The blueview theme, contributed by
[[BerndZeimetz]], featuring a panorama photo he took.

<br clear="both" />

[[!img none_small.png align=left]] For completeness, ikiwiki's default
anti-theme.

<br clear="both" />
