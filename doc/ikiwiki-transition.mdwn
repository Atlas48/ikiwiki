# NAME

ikiwiki-transition - transition ikiwiki pages to new syntaxes

# SYNOPSIS

ikiwiki-transition type ...

# DESCRIPTION

`ikiwiki-transition` aids in converting ikiwiki pages when
there's a major change in ikiwiki syntax.

Currently only one such transition is handled, the `prefix_directives` mode
converts the specified ikiwiki page from the old preprocessor directive
syntax, requiring a space, to the new syntax, prefixed by '!'.

Preprocessor directives which already use the new syntax will remain
unchanged.

Note that if the page contains wiki links with spaces, which some
older versions of ikiwiki accepted, the prefix_directives transition will
treat these as preprocessor directives and convert them.

One other transition is handled, the `indexdb` mode handles converting
a plain text `.ikiwiki/index` file to a binary `.ikiwiki/indexdb`. In this
mode, you should specify the srcdir of the wiki as the second parameter.
You do not normally need to run `ikiwiki-transition indexdb`; ikiwiki will
automatically run it as necessary.
