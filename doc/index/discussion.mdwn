Seems like there should be a page for you to post your thoughts about ikiwiki, both pro and con, anything that didn't work, ideas, or whatever. Do so here..

Note that for more formal bug reports or todo items, you can also edit the [[bugs]] and  [[todo]] pages.

How about adding ACL? So that you can control which users are allowed to read, write certain pages. The moinmoin wiki has that, and it is something, that I think is very valuable.

It would be interesting to have a `<TMPL_VAR BASEURL>` that would act exactly like the current `STYLEURL`, but without adding 'style.css' (`STYLEURL` could be defined in terms of `BASEURL`). This way it would be possible to have more flexible templates allowing multiple stylesheets, shortcut icons (and other images), etc.

	sub baseurl (;$) { #{{{
		my $page=shift;

		return "$config{url}/" if ! defined $page;
		
		$page=~s/[^\/]+$//;
		$page=~s/[^\/]+\//..\//g;
		return $page;
	} #}}}
