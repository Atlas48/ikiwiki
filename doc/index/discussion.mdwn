Seems like there should be a page for you to post your thoughts about
ikiwiki, both pro and con, anything that didn't work, ideas, or whatever.
Do so here..

Note that for more formal bug reports or todo items, you can also edit the
[[bugs]] and [[todo]] pages.

# Excellent - how do I translate a TWiki site?

I just discovered ikiwiki quite by chance, I was looking for a console/terminal
menu system and found pdmenu.  So pdmenu brought me to here and I've found ikiwiki!
It looks as if it's just what I've been wanting for a long time.  I wanted something
to create mostly text web pages which, as far as possible, have source which is human 
readable or at least in a standard format.  ikiwiki does this twice over by using 
markdown for the source and producing static HTML from it.

I'm currently using TWiki and have a fair number of pages in that format, does
anyone have any bright ideas for translating?  I can knock up awk scripts fairly
easily, perl is possible (but I'm not strong in perl).

# OpenID

I just figured I'd edit something on the page with my OpenID, since you've implemented it! --*[Kyle](http://kitenet.net/~kyle/)*=

> Kyle, If you like openid, I can switch your personal wiki over to use your openid. --[[Joey]]

# ACL

How about adding ACL? So that you can control which users are allowed
to read, write certain pages. The moinmoin wiki has that, and it is
something, that I think is very valuable.

Some questions about the RecentChanges function. -- Ethan

> (Moved to [[todo/recentchanges]] --[[Joey]])

Also, I'd like to request another template parameter which is just
$config{url}. That way you won't have to hard-code the URL of the wiki into
the template. -- Ethan

> That's already available in the BASEURL parameter. --[[Joey]]

# Canonical feed location?

Any way to use `inline` but point the feed links to a different feed on the
same site?  I have news in news/*, a news archive in news.mdwn, and the
first few news items on index.mdwn, but I don't really want two separate
feeds, one with all news and one with the latest few articles; I'd rather
point the RSS feed links of both to the same feed.  (Which one, the one
with all news or the one with the latest news only, I don't know yet.)

> Not currently. It could be implemented, or you could just turn off the

> page and rss feed. --[[Joey]]

>> That wouldn't use the same style for the RSS and Atom links, and it
