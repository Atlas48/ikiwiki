Seems like there should be a page for you to post your thoughts about
ikiwiki, both pro and con, anything that didn't work, ideas, or whatever.
Do so here..

Note that for more formal bug reports or todo items, you can also edit the
[[bugs]] and [[todo]] pages.

# ACL

How about adding ACL? So that you can control which users are allowed
to read, write certain pages. The moinmoin wiki has that, and it is
something, that I think is very valuable.

Some questions about the RecentChanges function. -- Ethan

Also, I'd like to request another template parameter which is just
$config{url}. That way you won't have to hard-code the URL of the wiki into
the template. -- Ethan

# Canonical feed location?

Any way to use `inline` but point the feed links to a different feed on the same site?  I have news in news/*, a news archive in news.mdwn, and the first few news items on index.mdwn, but I don't really want two separate feeds, one with all news and one with the latest few articles; I'd rather point the RSS feed links of both to the same feed.  (Which one, the one with all news or the one with the latest news only, I don't know yet.)
