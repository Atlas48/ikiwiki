Seems like there should be a page for you to post your thoughts about
ikiwiki, both pro and con, anything that didn't work, ideas, or whatever.
Do so here..

Note that for more formal bug reports or todo items, you can also edit the
[[bugs]] and [[todo]] pages.

# ACL

How about adding ACL? So that you can control which users are allowed
to read, write certain pages. The moinmoin wiki has that, and it is
something, that I think is very valuable.

Some questions about the RecentChanges function. 

* Why isn't it statically-genereated, but generated dynamically by CGI? It seems like it could be beneficial to have it rendered in the post-commit hook, just like everything else in the wiki. 
* Also, is it planned/desired that recent changes generate the same information in RSS feed format? This seems like it could be a useful way to keep track of the wiki as a whole. 
* Lastly, would it be possible to use the recent changes code with a pagespec? I understand this sort of infringes on territory covered by the inline plugin, but the inline plugin only puts a page in the RSS feed once, when it's created, and I imagine some people -- some deranged, obsessive-compulsive people like myself -- would like to know about the changes made to existing pages as well as newly-created pages.

Thanks for your time. -- Ethan

Also, I'd like to request another template parameter which is just $config{url}. That way you won't have to hard-code the URL of the wiki into the template. -- Ethan
