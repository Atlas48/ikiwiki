[Mercurial](http://selenic.com/mercurial) is a distributed revison control
system developed by Matt Mackall. Ikiwiki supports storing a wiki in a
mercurial repository.

Ikiwiki can run as a post-commit and/or install hook to update a wiki whenever commits or remote pushes
come in. When running as a [[cgi]] with Mercurial, ikiwiki automatically
commits edited pages, and uses the Mercurial history to generate the
[[RecentChanges]] page.
