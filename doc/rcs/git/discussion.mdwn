## Migrating from svn to git ##

I'd like to migrate from svn to git, because git is better in general but also has some nice properties that go well together with my use of ikiwiki.. I only change it myself. I want a single git repo so that my website directory is self-contained so that I don't need to drag around a separate svn repository on my computer. Is it possible to use ikiwiki so that it only uses a git repository in the same dir as all files are stored and edited?

Otherwise, I hope migrating is just importing the svn repo to git and then setting up ikiwiki to use git. I don't plan to go back to svn after that so git-svn should only do the import.
