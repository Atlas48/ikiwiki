## Migrating from svn to git ##

I'd like to migrate from svn to git, because git is better in general but also has some nice properties that go well together with my use of ikiwiki.. I only change it myself. I want a single git repo so that my website directory is self-contained so that I don't need to drag around a separate svn repository on my computer. Is it possible to use ikiwiki so that it only uses a git repository in the same dir as all files are stored and edited?

Otherwise, I hope migrating is just importing the svn repo to git and then setting up ikiwiki to use git. I don't plan to go back to svn after that so git-svn should only do the import.

### Solution ###
**Basis:** I only use ikiwiki as a wiki compiler. No cgi or anything.

I imported my svn repo into git with `git-svnimport`. I reconfigured ikiwiki to _not use any rcs_. In `ikiwiki.setup`, I have the git repository as srcdir, and a suitable dstdir. 

Then, in my git repository, I added this `post-commit` hook to refresh the wiki:

	#!/bin/sh

	# to refresh when changes happen

	BASE="/path/to/base/dir"
	SETUPFILE="$BASE/ikiwiki.setup"
	UNDERLAYDIR="$BASE/underlay"

	ikiwiki --refresh --setup "$SETUPFILE" --underlaydir="$UNDERLAYDIR" --verbose
