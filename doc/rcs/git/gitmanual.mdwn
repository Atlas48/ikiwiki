Main use case I am trying to accomplish: Edit wiki pages offline.

1. Imagine you're the administrator of the site and you want to checkout the wiki sources to give them some love while on a train journey.
2. Or you are writing a complex document and you want to simply use your favourite $EDITOR
3. Learn a little more about [git](http://git.or.cz/)

# Workflow

## on webconverger.org aka si.dabase.com aka hendry machine

Wiki page created with [ikiwiki](http://ikiwiki.info). Example usb.mdwn [usb](http://webconverger.org/usb/)

## on monty (my laptop)

    git-clone ssh://si.dabase.com/home/hendry/wikiwc/.git/

You might want to set some config variables like your email as this [tutorial](http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/tutorial.html) describes.

    echo "blah" >> usb.mdwn

Then to commit:

    git-commit -a -m "added test"

Send back:

    git push origin

## on webconverger.org aka si.dabase.com aka hendry machine

You should setup the "The git post-update wrapper" in the **ikiwiki.setup** file.

Then the wiki should be up-to-date! :)
