[monotone](http://monotone.ca/) is a distributed revision control system.
Ikiwiki supports storing a wiki in Monotone and editing it using the [[cgi]] interface.
It will use the Monotone logs to generate the [[RecentChanges]] page.

The monotone support requires the Monotone perl module (from the contrib/ directory
in the monotone source) to be installed. In particular, it needs version 0.03 or higher of that module.
The module is available from the monotone source repository at:
<http://viewmtn.angrygoats.net/branch/changes/net.venge.monotone>

Monotone support works, but there are still a few minor missing bits (listed here so they are not forgotten):

* At the moment there are no links to display diffs between revisions.  It shouldn't be hard to add links to a [ViewMTN](http://grahame.angrygoats.net/moinmoin/ViewMTN) instance, but it hasn't been done yet.
* Documentation (this page) could be improved.

There is also a mismatch between the way Ikiwiki handles conflicts and the way Monotone handles conflicts.  At present, if there is a conflict, then Ikiwiki will commit a revision with conflict markers before presenting it to the user.  This is ugly, but there is no clean way to fix it at present.
