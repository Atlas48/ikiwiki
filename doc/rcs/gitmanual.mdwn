Main use case I am trying to accomplish: Edit wiki pages offline.

1. Imagine you're the administrator of the site and you want to checkout the wiki sources to give them some love while on a train journey.
2. Or you are writing a complex document and you want to simply use your favourite $EDITOR
3. Learn a little more about [git](http://git.or.cz/)

I wonder why a "pull" doesn't just init a repo like a "svn co" does?

    monty:~/git-testing% git-init
    Initialized empty Git repository in .git/

    monty:~/git-testing% git-pull ssh://si.dabase.com/home/hendry/wikiwc/.git/
