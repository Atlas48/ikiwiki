WikiLinks provide easy linking between pages of the wiki. To create a
[[WikiLink]], just put the name of the page to link to in double brackets.
For example "\[[WikiLink]]".

If you ever need to write something like "\[[WikiLink]] without creating a
wikilink, just prefix it with a "\", like "\\\\[[WikiLink]]".

Note that there are some special [[SubPage/LinkingRules]] that come into
play when linking between [[SubPage]]s.

WikiLinks can be entered in any case you like, the page they link to is
always lowercased.

While a WikiLink is limited to alphanumerics and only a few special
charaters, it is possible to create page names containing other characters:

* To display a page name with a space in it, use "\_" in the WikiLink, for
  example, "\[[Multi\_Word\_Page\_Name]]". 
* For any other special character, you can use "\_\__nnnn_\_\_" where
 _nnnn_ is the unicode character number. For example,
  "\[[This\_page\_name\_is\_\_44\_\_\_uselessly\_\_44\_\_\_a\_complete\_sentence\_\_46\_\_]]"
  Limiting use of this to when you really need it is a good idea.

Note that if the file linked to by a WikiLink looks like an image, it will
be displayed inline on the page.
