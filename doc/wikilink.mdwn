WikiLinks provide easy linking between pages of the wiki. To create a
WikiLink, just put the name of the page to link to in double brackets. For
examples "[[ WikiLink ]]" (without the added whitespace). 

Note that there are some special [[SubPage/LinkingRules]] that come into
play when linking between [[SubPage]]s.

WikiLinks can be entered in any case you like, the page they link to is
always lowercased.
