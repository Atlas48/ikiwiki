Here's how to get ikiwiki. See [[setup]] for how to use it, and be sure to
add your wiki to [[IkiwikiUsers]] if you use ikiwiki.

# tarball

The best place to download a tarball of the latest release is from 
<http://packages.debian.org/unstable/source/ikiwiki>.

# packages

If using Debian unstable or testing, or Ubuntu edgy:

        apt-get install ikiwiki

Or download the deb from <http://packages.debian.org/unstable/web/ikiwiki>.

While this deb has been developed on Debian unstable, it should also work
on stable, although to get the CGI stuff working on stable, you will need
to upgrade to a newer version of libcgi-formbuilder-perl, `3.02.02`,
and libcgi-session-perl `4.14-1`

There is also an unofficial backport of ikiwiki for Debian stable, provided by
Pawel Tecza, at <http://gpa.net.icm.edu.pl/debian/>.
