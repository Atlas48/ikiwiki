Here's how to get ikiwiki. See [[setup]] for how to use it, and be sure to
add your wiki to [[IkiwikiUsers]] if you use ikiwiki.

## tarball

The best place to download a tarball of the latest release is from 
<http://packages.debian.org/unstable/source/ikiwiki>.

Installation steps and requirements are listed on the [[install]] page.

## packages

If using Debian (since 4.0), or Ubuntu (since 6.10):
[[template id=note text="""
Note that Debian 4.0 and especially Ubuntu 6.10 contain older versions of
ikiwiki, there have been lots of enhancements and bug fixes since those
versions.
"""]]

        apt-get install ikiwiki

Or download the deb from <http://packages.debian.org/unstable/web/ikiwiki>.

There is a backport of a recent version of ikiwiki for Debian 4.0 at
<http://packages.debian.org/etch-backports/ikiwiki>.

There is also an unofficial backport of ikiwiki for Debian 3.1, provided by
Paweł Tęcza, at <http://gpa.net.icm.edu.pl/debian/>.

Also. FreeBSD has ikiwiki in its
[ports collection](http://www.freshports.org/www/ikiwiki/).
