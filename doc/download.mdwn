Here's how to get ikiwiki. See [[setup]] for how to use it, and be sure to
add your wiki to [[IkiwikiUsers]] if you use ikiwiki.

# tarball

The best place to download a tarball of the latest release is from 
<http://packages.debian.org/unstable/source/ikiwiki>.

# Debian package

If using Debian unstable or testing:

        apt-get install ikiwiki

Or download the deb from <http://packages.debian.org/unstable/web/ikiwiki>.

While this deb has been developed on Debian unstable, it should also work
on stable, although to get the CGI stuff working on stable, you will need
to upgrade to a newer version of libcgi-formbuilder-perl, `3.02.02`, and libcgi-session-perl `4.14-1`

There is also an unofficial backport of ikiwiki for Debian stable, provided by
Pawel Tecza, at <http://gpa.net.icm.edu.pl/debian/>.

# subversion

The current development version of ikiwiki can be accessed using subversion at 
`svn://ikiwiki.kitenet.net/ikiwiki/trunk`

The source in subversion can be browsed
[here](http://ikiwiki.kitenet.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/trunk/?root=ikiwiki).

If you would like to be subscribed to svn commit messages for ikiwiki,
mail joey@kitenet.net.

# arch

An unofficial arch mirror of the subversion repository is at
`http://arch.debian.org/arch/private/srivasta/archive-2006-misc`
and can be browsed [here](http://arch.debian.org/cgi-bin/archzoom.cgi/srivasta@debian.org--2006-misc?color=default?layout=larger?expand).
