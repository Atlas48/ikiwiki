Here's how to get ikiwiki. See [[setup]] for how to use it, and be sure to add your page to [[ikiwikiusers]] if you use ikiwiki.

## tarball

Currently the tarball for the 1.0 release is available for download from [here](http://kitenet.net/~joey/debian/unstable/ikiwiki_1.0.tar.gz).

## Debian package

While ikiwiki is being added to Debian, the deb can be downloaded from [here](http://kitenet.net/~joey/debian/unstable/ikiwiki_1.0_all.deb).

While this deb has been developed on Debian unstable, it should also work on stable, although to get the CGI stuff working on stable, you will need to upgrade to a newer version of libcgi-formbuilder-perl, `3.02.02`.

## subversion

The current development version of ikiwiki can be accessed using subversion at 
`svn://svn.kitenet.net/ikiwiki/trunk`
