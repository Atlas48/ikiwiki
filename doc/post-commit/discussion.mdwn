Hi Joey and many thanks for your work on ikiwiki, as usual you give us a very good soft...

I want to be able to edit my website from a navigator (with the CGI) and
from my favorite editor on my laptop. I have managed to use the subversion wrapper
so I have write a post-commit hook with : 

    cd /~/wikisrc/ 
    svn up
    /usr/bin/ikiwiki --setup ../ikiwiki.setup

at the end.

This configuration works for me, the svn wrapper doesn't seems to
do the svn up stuff so I wonder if I've missed something...

Regards.
