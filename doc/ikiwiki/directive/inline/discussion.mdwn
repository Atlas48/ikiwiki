## How do you provide the per post discussion links in your own blog?

And do you have any ideas/hints about implementing a "comments" feature.
What I'm after is something for users who don't quite understand the Wiki
style for discussions.  I would like to have a form for them to post a
comment and have the comment appended to the discussion Wiki-style.  Maybe
take it as far as implementing "replies" to other comments.

## More dynamic `rootpage` parameter of inline plugin?

## Excluding Images

Is there a simple way to exclude images, stylesheets, and other
"non-page" files other than a blacklist approach like
`pages="* and !*.png and !*.css"`?  --[[JasonBlevins]]
