The `format` directive is supplied by the [[!iki plugins/format desc=format]]
plugin.

The directive allows formatting a chunk of text using any available page
format. It takes two parameters. First is the type of format to use,
ie the extension that would be used for a standalone file of this type.
Second is the text to format.

For example, this will embed an otl outline inside a page using mdwn or
some other format:

	\[[!format otl """
	foo
		1
		2
	bar
		3
		4
	"""]]
