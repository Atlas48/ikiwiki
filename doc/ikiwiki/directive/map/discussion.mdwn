Question: Is there a way to generate a listing that shows *both* title and description meta information? Currently, a \[\[!map ...]] shows only one of the two, but I'd like to generate a navigation that looks like a description list. For example:

 * This is the title meta information.

   This is the description meta information

 * This is another title.  

   And so on ...

Is that possible?
