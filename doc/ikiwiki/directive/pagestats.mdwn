The `pagestats` directive is supplied by the [[!iki plugins/pagestats desc=pagestats]] plugin.

This directive can generate stats about how pages link to each other. It can
produce either a tag cloud, or a table counting the number of links to each
page.

Here's how to use it to create a [[tag]] cloud:

	\[[!pagestats pages="tags/*"]]

And here's how to create a table of all the pages on the wiki:

	\[[!pagestats style="table"]]

[[!meta robots="noindex, follow"]]
