I am trying to create a tag cloud using:  
           
     \[[!pagestats  pages="tags/*"]]

Nothing shows up when I first used this directive. I found that I had to create a page for the tag for it to show up in pagestats.
I would rather not find and create a page for every tag I have created or will create. Is there an easier way to create a list of tags?

Thanks
