## How to insert an image?

I have goodstuff; I don't have img disabled.

I used

    \[[!img utah-2006-100-180.png]]

and

    \[[utah-2006-100-180.png]]

and

    \[[!img utah-2006-100-180.png link=no]]

But it doesn't show the image file I already put in that directory. I can access the file by directly going to it in my browser. I want to see it on my wiki page.

It does show a clickable question mark for ikiwiki.cgi?page=utah-2006-100-180.png&from=roadtrips&do=create
