Is anyone else having trouble using the definition list feature of multimarkdown?  If not, then I could use some help figuring out why it's not working on my text site.  Version is 3.141~bpo50+1 (debian backports), multimarkdown and mdwn support enabled in preferences.  Any pointers to the obvious thing I'm missing would be appreciated. - dave
