Some [[directives|ikiwiki/directive]] that use
[[PageSpecs|ikiwiki/pagespec]] allow
specifying the order that matching pages are shown in. The following sort
orders can be specified.

* `age` - List pages from the most recently created to the oldest.
* `mtime` - List pages with the most recently modified first.
* `title` - Order by title.
* `title_natural` - Only available if [[!cpan Sort::Naturally]] is
  installed. Orders by title, but numbers in the title are treated
  as such, ("1 2 9 10 20" instead of "1 10 2 20 9")
[[!if test="enabled(meta)" then="""
* `meta_title` - Order by the full title set by the `\[[!meta title="foo"]]`
  [[ikiwiki/directive]].

Plugins can add additional sort orders, so more might be available on this
wiki.
