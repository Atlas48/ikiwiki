The [[ikiwiki/directive/brokenlinks]] directive lists emails when used inside [[ikiwiki/wikilink]]s: \[[john.doo@example.com\]] -> [[john.doo@example.com]]. Obviously its is a bug since 1) there is a link generated in the page; 2) "fixing" the broken link in the brokenlinks page may yield to stange results [[http://ikiwiki.info/ikiwiki.cgi?page=john.doo__64__example.com&do=create]].

> Weird.  The bug, imho, is that `\[[email-address]]` results in a marked-up email address. I think marking up email addresses into hyperlinks should be handled by a markup plugin (e.g. markdown), not by the wikilink parser.… — [[Jon]]
