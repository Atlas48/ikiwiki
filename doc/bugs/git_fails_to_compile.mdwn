Background: I'm running ikiwiki on OS X leopard, (a laptop), and I have the wiki running locally, as it's mostly for note taking and personal stuff. Anyway. 

I'd been using svn, but I'm making the leap to git (finally) and moving the wiki over as well... 

The git works great, I am in fact, quite pleased. Here's the problem. When I try and run `ikiwiki --setup [setupfile]` I get the following message: 

	Can't exec "git": No such file or directory at /opt/local/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.8.8/IkiWiki/Rcs/git.pm line 29.
	/Users/tychoish/.ikiwiki/ikiwiki.setup: Cannot exec 'git log --max-count=50 --pretty=raw --raw --abbrev=40 --always -c -r HEAD -- .': No such file or directory
	BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at (eval 6) line 139.

	/Users/$HOME/.ikiwiki/ikiwiki.setup: 'git log --max-count=50 --pretty=raw --raw --abbrev=40 --always -c -r HEAD -- .' failed: 
	BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at (eval 6) line 139.

---

I can get the wiki to compile if: I take the git stuff out of the setup file, if I put `rcs => ""` **or** if I set the the git_master_branch to "".

I think the problem is that ikiwiki can't deal with the onslaught of such a large quantity of history/log information at once, somehow, because the repository came to this moment with a lot of history that the compiler has to crunch through. How to remedy this, is beyond my skill insight... 

Thanks.
