I can't seem to login to ikiwiki sites reliably anymore.

I am not sure what is going on. It affects this wiki and the git-annex
wiki. I am editing this through the anonymous git push interface.

OpenID is failing on me. That is, sometimes it works, sometimes it
doesn't. For example, while writing this, I clicked the "Preferences"
link and I seemed to have been logged in automatically without
problem, even though I previously *tried* to login and failed with an
error similar to [[bugs/Error:_OpenID_failure:_time_bad_sig:]], which
of course I cannot reproduce anymore on ikiwiki.info now:

    Error: OpenID failure: time_bad_sig: Return_to signature is not
    valid.

I *can* still reproduce this on the git-annex wiki, however, which is
odd. This *could* be because the OpenID host is screwing up, as I am
not directly responsible for that box anymore... but then why would it
work on one wiki and not the other?

But worse, I cannot login with my regular non-OpenID user, which I
started using more regularly now. When I type the wrong password, the
login form gives me "Invalid entry" next to the password field. But
then if I do a password recall and reset my password, I get a
different error:

    Error: login failed, perhaps you need to turn on cookies?

That happens reliably on git-annex.branchable.com. ikiwiki.info seems
to be more stable: i can eventually login. i can login to my personal
wiki with OpenID fine. I can also login to branchable.com itself with
openid without issues.

So I guess the problem is mostly with git-annex.branchable.com? Not
sure how to debug this further.

Thanks. --[[anarcat]]

Update: now I can't login to the ikiwiki.info site anymore, getting
the same errors as on the git-annex site.
