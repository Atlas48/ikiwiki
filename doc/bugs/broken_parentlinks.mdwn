The header of subpages always links to its "superpage", even if it doesn't
exist. I'm not sure if this is a feature or a bug, but I would certainly prefer
that superpages weren't mandatory.

For example, if you are in 'example/page.html', the header will be something
like 'wiki / example / page'. Now, if 'example.html' doesn't exist, you'll have
a dead link for every subpage.
