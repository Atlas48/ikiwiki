(Moved from [[plugins/recentchanges/discussion]])

I've just upgraded to ikiwiki 2.50 with the `recentchanges` plugin enabled, and
figured out that I have to turn on `rss` in `ikiwiki.setup` in order to get the
recentchanges feed. Now the feed shows up, but the links in the feed go to the
change pages, e.g. `recentchanges/change_1700.html`.  I can see a `recentchanges`
directory created in the working copy, containing files like `change_1700._change`
but for some reason they are not getting htmlized and carried over. I can see
in `recentchanges.pm` that it explicitly registers an `htmlize` hook for the
`_change` type, but something isn't happening. I also see `return if $type=~/^_/;` in
`render()` in `Render.pm` so I guess the upshot is I'm not sure how this is
supposed to work; is there a bug here or just something I overlooked that I need
to turn on? --Chapman Flack
