I try to create wikilink in table. But it does not work. Here is example:

    [[table class=table1 data="""
    [[wikilink_test|servers/webmail1]]
    [[wikilink_test\|servers/webmail1]]
    [wikilink test](/servers/webmail1)
    """]]

First two do not work.

The last one is url link and it works but it is not a wikilink. Or maybe it does not matter if I use URL links in stead of wikilinks ?

What exactly is a difference between wikilink and URL reference to the same page ?
