I originally set up ikiwiki by using the debian package, but had some odd issues, so i figured i'd try installing from git. To do that i uninstalled the debian package and then did the Makefile dance from the git dir. In that process the original dirs configured in templatedir underlaydir in my wiki were deleted; HOWEVER when rebuilding the script just went ahead and did not even note the lack of those dirs. It would be nice if it threw errors if the dirs were configured, but non-existant.
