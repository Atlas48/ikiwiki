When renaming a page here, ikiwiki destroyed unrelated links from unrelated pages. You can see the effect [here](http://mesh.openisp.ca/recentchanges/#diff-dc8dfa96efd3a4d649f571c3aa776f20b3ce0131), or by checking out the git tree (`git://mesh.openisp.ca/
`) and looking at commit `dc8dfa96efd3a4d649f571c3aa776f20b3ce0131`.

The renamed page was `configuration/bat-hosts` to `configuration/batman/bat-hosts` and the deleted links were ``\[[AUR | https://aur.archlinux.org/]]` and `\[[CHANGELOG|http://svn.dd-wrt.com:8000/browser/src/router/batman-adv/CHANGELOG]]`. --[[anarcat]]
