If you're using ikiwiki without installing it, the svn post-commit wrapper will die (in a difficult-to-debug way) when it tries to execute ikiwiki.pl because it can't find IkiWiki.pm.

I'm not sure how to fix this in a secure way. For now I'm just changing use lib '.' in ikiwiki.pl to point to the hard-coded directory where ikiwiki was unpacked.

    -use lib '.'; # For use without installation, removed by Makefile.
    +use FindBin qw($Bin); # WILL_BE_REMOVED by Makefile.
    +use lib ($Bin=~/(.+)/ ? "$1" : '.'); # For use without installation, WILL_BE_REMOVED by Makefile.
