In [[markdown]] syntax, none of the other special characters get processed inside a code block.  However, in ikiwiki, [[wiki links|wikilinks]] and [[preprocessor directives|preprocessordirectives]] still get processed inside a code block, requiring additional escaping.  For example, `[links don't work](#here)`, but `a [[wikilink]] becomes HTML`.
