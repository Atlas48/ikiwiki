In [[markdown]] syntax, none of the other special characters get processed inside a code block.  However, in ikiwiki, [[wiki links|wikilink]] and [[preprocessor directives|preprocessordirective]] still get processed inside a code block, requiring additional escaping.  For example, `[links don't work](#here)`, but `a [[wikilink]] becomes HTML`. --[[JoshTriplett]]

Indented lines provide a good way to escape a block of text containing
markdown syntax, but ikiwiki links like \[[this]] are still
interpreted within such a block. I think that intepretation should not
be happening. That is I should be able to write:

	[[this]]

and have it render like:

	\[[this]]
