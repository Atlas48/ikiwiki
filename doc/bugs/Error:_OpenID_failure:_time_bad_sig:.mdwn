Sometimes when I try to login (to edit a page) here then I can see
the following error message:

    Error: OpenID failure: time_bad_sig:

Please note that authorization process successes on OpenID server side.

It occurs both for [getopenid.com](http://www.getopenid.com/)
and [myopenid.com](http://www.myopenid.com/) servers I use.

I'm reporting this, but I'm not sure whether a problem is with your
ikiwiki or my OpenID servers. --[[PaweÅ‚|ptecza]]

I've had this problem too, but with my track record of reporting OpenID bugs 
I thought it best if I held my tongue. I usually experience this the first
time I sign in on any ikiwiki installation of {ikiwiki.kitenet, ikidev, 
betacantrips}, and I think re-logging in always works. --Ethan

Hmmmmm, looks like it is not entirely fixed.  I am getting it on my own
[blog](http://blog.tobez.org/).  Just upgraded to 3.20110430, same same.
I am using custom openid with redirection to myopenid.com.
Please tell me if you need more info.  The same openid worked fine to login to *this* site to post this.
