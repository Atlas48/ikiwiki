Sometimes when I try to login (to edit a page) here then I can see
the following error message:

    Error: OpenID failure: time_bad_sig:

Please note that authorization process successes on OpenID server side.

It occurs both for [getopenid.com](http://www.getopenid.com/)
and [myopenid.com](http://www.myopenid.com/) servers I use.

I'm reporting this, but I'm not sure whether a problem is with your
ikiwiki or my OpenID servers. --Pawel
