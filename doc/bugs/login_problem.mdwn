For around 2 weeks, I've been getting an increasing quantity of nonspecific
reports from users of login problems on ikiwiki sites, mostly joeyh.name
and git-annex.branchable.com. A few users are still logging in
successfully, but it seems to be hitting many users; post volume has gone
down more than holidays would explain.

It doesn't seem limited to any login method; email and password have both
been said not to work. (Openid too, but could be openid provider problem
there.)

I have not managed to reproduce the problem myself, using firefox,
firefox-esr, or chromium. --[[Joey]]
