I'm writing [pykipandoc plugin](https://github.com/temmen/pykipandoc/blob/master/pykipandoc), that work at least as pandoc-iki.

It works in compile mode, editing pages in web mode however results in 

    pandoc: : hGetContents: invalid argument (Invalid or incomplete multibyte or wide character)

I think that is because HTTP POST request building editpage doesn't correctly manage utf-8 contents: see strange chars in this form-data name="editcontent"?

    This principle has guided pandocâ€™s decisions in finding syntax for tables, footnotes, and other extensions.

Please, any advice can be sent to [GitHub pykipandoc](https://github.com/temmen/pykipandoc) (some other info there on the [README](https://github.com/temmen/pykipandoc/blob/master/README.md)) and to [temmenel(at)gmail(dot)com](mailto:temmenel@gmail.com).

¡Thank you all!
