ikiwiki version 3.20170111 on  Debian 4.9.30-2+deb9u3 with locale fr_FR.UTF-8

UTF-8 characters like û and é get turned into the unicode replacement character (xFFFD) in "Last edited" date, "published" date and in the calendar plugin content.
User provided content (page title or content) isn't affected.

Examples here : https://blog.chat-porc.eu/archives/2017/

Having strftime_utf8 systematically return POSIX::strftime(@_) resolves the bug, but I'm pretty sure it's not a proper fix.
