[[!meta title="aggregate/inline planets wrongly link to posts"]]

Please see 
<http://vcs-pkg.org/planet/>. The headers of posts link to the HTML pages, which ikiwiki scraped. Also, the `\[[meta]]` titles and author directives aren't processed, but included inline. I believe that the headers should link to the posts directly, not the "cached" copies ikiwiki keeps around.

What's also not ideal is that the cached copies can be edited. Any edits there will never make it to the VCS and thus won't show up in recentchanges.
