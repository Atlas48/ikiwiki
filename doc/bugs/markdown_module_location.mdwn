If the Markdown module is installed via CPAN rather than apt then
the module is actually Text::Markdown.

I had to edit the source to change this on my old server. I have filed
a [bug](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=387687) against
the Debian markdown, which I guess you can consider a blocking bug of this.

I tried to come up with the magical invocation to allow either location 
to be used by ikiwiki, but I couldn't do it.
