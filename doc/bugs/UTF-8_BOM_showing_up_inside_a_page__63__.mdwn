I have a git-backed ikiwiki install, and when I commit and push a file from an x86 host (LANG=en_US.UTF-8) to the Ikiwiki box, which is Debian GNU/Linux on Sparc, I sometimes get unusual characters (ef bb ff) before the first character of the wiki text.  It seems that this is a UTF-8 "byte order mark" that is getting inserted automatically into the .wiki file by my editor: http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/VimTip246#Tip:_.23246_-_Working_with_Unicode 

Example:

        http://monkey.linuxworld.com/lwce-2007/

Is there any way for ikiwiki to spot when .wiki files have this BOM and deal with it, or should I make sure to strip it out before committing?
