I edited some pages on the ikiwiki ikiwiki ([[/shortcuts]] and
[[/ikiwikiusers]]).  The edits show up in RecentChanges and History, but not
in the compiled pages.  --[[JoshTriplett]]

html pages that it didn't have record of. I don't know what build failed
exactly. --[[Joey]]

>> Has this just happened again? [[patchqueue/datearchives-plugin]] is now exhibiting the same symptoms -- it's in the repository and RecentChanges, but the actual page is 404. --Ben
