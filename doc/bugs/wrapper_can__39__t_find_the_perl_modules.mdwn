If i intsall perl modules in my custom directory, cgi wrapper can't find them. I found clearing enviroment variables in code  of wrapper. But information about custom directories put to perl with PERL5LIB variable.

Workaround: add newenviron variable PERL5LIB

My additional question - what wrapper do? I'am russian hosting provider. I am interesting with ikiwiki.
