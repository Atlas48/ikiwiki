## What I did

A friend reported this, and I'm seeing it too. With 3.20140916, on
a system with Python 2.7 and 3.4 (and little else) installed, I
tried to run the auto.setup:

    :; ikiwiki --setup /etc/pkg/ikiwiki/auto.setup
    What will the wiki be named? Import Errors
    What revision control system to use? git
    Which user (wiki account or openid) will be admin? schmonz

## What I expected

I expected to get a basic site.

## What happened instead

I got a basic site with some Python error messages.

## Likely fix

Looks like `proxy.py` needs the trick from [[!debbug 637604]] so
that it can defer a few imports (at least `xml.parsers.expat` and
the XML-RPC libs) until the methods using them are called. --[[schmonz]]
