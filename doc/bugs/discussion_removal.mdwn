If a page has a discussion page, which is then removed, ikiwiki seems not
to notice that the discussion page has gone away, and does not update the
link to it in the action bar.

Looks to me like loadindex is populating %destsources with information
that the old discussion page exists, which isn't invalidated when ikiwiki
discovers that the page is gone. This leaves dangling links whenever *any*
page is deleted, not just a discussion page. --Ethan
