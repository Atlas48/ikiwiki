If I try to authenticate using openid to my site, it tries to create a http or https connection to the openid server. This doesn't work, because the direct connection is blocked by the firewall.

It would be good if ikiwiki supported setting up a proxy server to solve this.

I have found if I add:

    newenviron[i++]="HTTPS_PROXY=http://host.domain.com:3128";

to IkiWiki/Wrapper.pm it solves the problem for https requests, however it obviously would be preferred if the proxy name is not configured.

Also, the ability to set HTTPS\_CA\_FILE and HTTPS\_CA\_DIR might benefit some people. Then again, it I can't see any evidence that the SSL certificate of the server is being checked.

Unfortunately, HTTP\_PROXY doesn't work for http requests, it looks like that library is different.
