The [[ikiwiki/directive/listdirectives]]` directive doesn't register a link between the page and the subpages. This is a problem because then the [[ikiwiki/directive/orphans]] directive then marks the directives as orphans... Maybe it is a but with the orphans directive however... A simple workaround is to exclude those files from the orphans call... --[[anarcat]]
