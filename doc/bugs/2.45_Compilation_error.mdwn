I have perl 5.10.0. Ikiwiki 2.44 compiles fine. Compiling 2.45 fails after 'make':

    perl -Iblib/lib   ikiwiki.out -libdir . -setup docwiki.setup -refresh
    refreshing wiki..
    docwiki.setup: Failed to load plugin IkiWiki::Plugin::goodstuff: Failed to load plugin IkiWiki::Plugin::shortcut: Too many arguments for IkiWiki::srcfile at IkiWiki/Plugin/shortcut.pm line 16, near "1)"
    Compilation failed in require at (eval 31) line 2.
    BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at (eval 31) line 2.
    BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at (eval 23) line 2.

    make: *** [extra_build] Error 255

OK, this is what I'm getting:

    $ perl -Iblib/lib -V
    @INC:
    blib/lib
    /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.10.0
    /usr/share/perl5/site_perl/5.10.0
    /usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl
    /usr/share/perl5/vendor_perl
    /usr/share/perl5/vendor_perl
    /usr/lib/perl5/core_perl
    /usr/share/perl5/core_perl
    /usr/lib/perl5/current
    /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/current

I ran the following in my current 2.45 source dir, where the `make` already succeded. If you need it, I can post the output
in the case where `make` fails.

    $ strace perl -Iblib/lib -e 'use IkiWiki' 2>&1 |grep IkiWiki.pm
    stat64("blib/lib/IkiWiki.pmc", 0xbfa6167c) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
    stat64("blib/lib/IkiWiki.pm", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0444, st_size=31901, ...}) = 0
    open("blib/lib/IkiWiki.pm", O_RDONLY|O_LARGEFILE) = 3
