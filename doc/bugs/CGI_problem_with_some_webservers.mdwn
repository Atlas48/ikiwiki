The edit function has a problem when running with [[debpkg thttpd]]
or [[debpkg mini-httpd]]: for some reason the headers ikiwiki
outputs are transmitted as the page content.

Here is what it looks like in iceweasel:

    Set-Cookie: ikiwiki_session_apnkit=99dad8d796bc6c819523649ef25ea447; path=/
    Date: Tue, 14 Aug 2007 17:16:32 GMT
    Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
    
    <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"
     "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
    <html>
    (...)

Ikiwiki runs fine with [[debpkg boa]].
