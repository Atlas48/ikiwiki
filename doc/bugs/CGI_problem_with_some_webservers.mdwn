The "ikwiki.cgi?page=index&do=edit" function has a problem
when running with [[!debpkg thttpd]] or [[!debpkg mini-httpd]]:
for some reason the headers ikiwiki outputs are transmitted
as the page content. Surprisingly, the "do=prefs" function
works as expected.

Here is what it looks like in iceweasel:

    Set-Cookie: ikiwiki_session_apnkit=99dad8d796bc6c819523649ef25ea447; path=/
    Date: Tue, 14 Aug 2007 17:16:32 GMT

    <html>
    (...)

Ikiwiki runs fine with [[!debpkg boa]].

It doesn't work for signin either.
What is the reason for these "header => 1" in FormBuilder initialisations?
Why do they appear two times with conflicting values in the very same hashes?

Marking [[done]] since it's not really an ikiwiki bug. --[[Joey]]

I'm getting some odd behaviour with boa.  When I edit a page and click "Save
Page", the URL I get taken to produces a 403 - Forbidden error until I recompile
the wiki.  For example, after editing the root page of the wiki it brings me back to
`http://localhost/~pdw/iki/?updated`, and I see a 403 error message.  Then, if
I open up a terminal and type `ikiwiki --setup ikiwiki.setup`, and then go back
to the browser and hit Ctrl-R, the page displays correctly, with the same URL
that gave an error a moment ago.  This is with boa 0.94.14rc21-3 and Firefox
3.0.11 on Ubuntu 9.04.  I get the feeling I'm doing something wrong somewhere;
any suggestions where to start looking?  This is a very basic setup, so feel
free to ask. --Paul

Tried setting up a git repository back-end for the wiki, in case the `post-update`
hook caused the right updates to happen; it didn't.  (But I do now have my wiki
in git!)

Turns out that `.../destdir/index.html` was being recreated after a web edit, or
at least having its permissions modified, and being left without world-read
permissions.  Boa was then rightly refusing to serve the page.  Adding the
`umask 022` config option to `ikiwiki.setup` fixed everything, and all
appears to be working fine now.  --Paul.

(I'm new to wiki etiquette - would it be more polite to leave these details on the
wiki, or to remove them and only leave a short summary?  Thanks.  --Paul)
