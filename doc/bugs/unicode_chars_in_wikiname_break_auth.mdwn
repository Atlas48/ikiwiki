I spent hours trying to understand why my wiki suddenly refused me to log in (using passwordauth).
The failure message was always: `login failed, perhaps you need to turn on cookies?`

Inspecting the cookie information (thanks to Iceweasel's webdeveloper add-on), I realized there were some weird-looking encoded chars in the cookie name.

Replacing "Â·" with "-" in `wikiname` fixed this login issue.

(BTW, such a char was replaced by -I don't remember what encoding thingie- in my setup file, when running `ikiwiki-transition setupformat`.)
