Escaping pipe-symbol in taglink targets doesn't work as I wanted:

[[!taglink smth_with_a_pipe|about_the_\|-symbol]]
[[!taglink smth_with_a_pipe|about_the_|-symbol]]

as opposed to simple wikilinks:

[[a link to smth with a pipe|about the \|-symbol]]
[[a link to smth with a pipe|about the |-symbol]]

And it works in pagespecs:

[[!map pages="tagged(about the |-symbol)"]]
[[!map pages="tagged(about the \|-symbol)"]]
