The po plugin's protection against processing loops (i.e. the
alreadyfiltered stuff) is playing against us: the template plugin
triggers a filter hooks run with the very same ($page, $destpage)
arguments pair that is used to identify an already filtered page.

Processing an included template can then mark the whole translation
page as already filtered, which prevented `po_to_markup` to be called on
the PO content.

Symptoms: the unprocessed gettext file goes unfiltered to the
generated HTML.

This has been fixed in my po branch.

> My commit dcd57dd5c9f3265bb7a78a5696b90976698c43aa updates the
> bugfix in a much more elegant manner. Its main disadvantage is to
> add an (optional) argument to IkiWiki::filter. Please review.
