When adding a new english page, the po files are created, committed,
and then committed again. The second commit makes this change:

	-"Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8\n"
	-"Content-Transfer-Encoding: ENCODING"
	+"Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\n"
	+"Content-Transfer-Encoding: ENCODING\n"

Same thing happens when a change to an existing page triggers a po file
update. --[[Joey]] 

> * The s/utf-8/UTF-8 part has been fixed.
> * The ENCODING\n part is due to an inconsistency in po4a, which
>   I've just send a patch for. --[[intrigeri]]
