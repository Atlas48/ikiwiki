In setting up my wiki I followed the [[setup]] instruction which point
to an [[ikiwiki.setup]] file that contains "verbose => 0".

I hadn't noticed that setting in there, but later when I changed my
standard command of:

	ikiwiki --setup ikiwiki.setup

to:

	ikiwiki --verbose --setup ikiwiki.setup

I was quite surprised that that change didn't have any effect.

So two suggestions to fix this:

1. Make command-line arguments override settings in the setup file

> This is difficult to do, since reading a setup file replaces values for
> config items with the values in the setup file.

2. Comment out all settings in the example setup file that are simply
   setting options to their default values. That way, the file will
   still be self-documenting, but command-line arguments will at least
   work for these settings while they remain commented out.
