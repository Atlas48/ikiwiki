When I create a new page and upload an attachment all is fine.

If I try to upload a second attachment (or remove the previously uploaded attachment), no upload happens. Instead the page gets created. No matter what I typed in, I just get a map to show the attachment. Now I can edit this page and everything is fine again.

Another workaround is to first save the text and then edit and upload the rest.

Is this a problem on my site or does anyone else see this?

(If it's my fault feel free to move this to [[forum]].)
