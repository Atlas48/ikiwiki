Text::Markdown obfuscates email addresses in the href= attribute and in the text.
Apparently this can't be configured.

HTML::Scrubber doesn't set `attr_encoded` for its HTML::Parser, so the href= attribtute is decoded.
Currently it seems it doesn't set `attr_encoded` for good reason: so attributes can be sanitized easily,
e.g. as in htmlscrubber with `$safe_url_regexp`.
This apparently can't be configured either.

So I can't see an obvious solution to this.
Perhaps improvements to Text::Markdown or HTML::Scrubber can allow a fix.

One question is: how useful is email obfuscation?
Don't spammers use HTML parsers?
