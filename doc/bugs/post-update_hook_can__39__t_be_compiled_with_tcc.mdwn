Thinking that any c compiler would do the job, I tried to use tcc with ikiwiki, as explicitely allowed by the Debian package dependencies.

I installed `tcc` and `libc6-dev` (for `libcrt1`). The wrapper compilation was OK, but the wrapper fails to run correctly and dies with

    usage: ikiwiki [options] source dest
       ikiwiki --setup configfile

Everything works fine with gcc.

versions: Debian etch+backports
