In my wiki I have a template page under `/templates` that looks like this:

    \[[!inline                                                                       
          pages="<TMPL_VAR PAGE>/* and !<TMPL_VAR PAGE>/*/*"                    
          show=0                                                                
          template=titlepage                                                    
          feeds=no                                                              
          sort=title]]                                                          
                                                                                    
    \[[!trailitems                                                                   
              pages="<TMPL_VAR PAGE>/* and !<TMPL_VAR PAGE>/*/*"                
              sort=title]]

I tested this page with many variations and by trial and error reached a conclusion that
when using `trailitems` with a path that contains TMPL_VAR, or using the inline directive
with `trail=yes` and a `pages` that contains TMPL_VAR, the trail plugin (or something else?)
seems to not resolve the TMPL_VAR and ikiwiki fails to compile the wiki, and I get this:

    syntax error in pagespec "<TMPL_VAR PAGE>/* and !<TMPL_VAR PAGE>/*/*"

on the command line.

Until I get feedback here I'll try to look at the source and see if I figure it out.

Huge thanks in advance!
