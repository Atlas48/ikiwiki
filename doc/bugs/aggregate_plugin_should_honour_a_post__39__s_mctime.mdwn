It would be nice if the [[aggregate_plugin|plugin/aggregate]] would try to extract the m/ctime out of each post and touch the files on the filesystem appropriately, so that ikiwiki reflects the actual time of the post via the [[inline_plugin|plugin/inline]], rather than the time when the aggregation ran to pull the post in. --[[madduck]]
