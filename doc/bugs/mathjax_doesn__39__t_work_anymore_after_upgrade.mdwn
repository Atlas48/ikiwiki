After my upgrade from ubuntu 14.04 to 15.04 mathjax stopped working in my ikiwiki. Math is displayed correctly for pages created before the upgrade. For new pages or if I change an old page, math is not rendered but the LaTeX source code is printed (with \[ \] as deliminiters instead of $$ $$). 

Any idea what may be wrong here and how to fix it?
