I am using mercurial as RCS backend and ikiwiki 2.40.

It seems that, when adding a blog post, it is not immediately commited to the mercurial repo. I have a page with this directive:

    \[[!inline pages="journal/blog2008/* and !*/Discussion" show="0" feeds="no" actions="yes" rootpage="journal/blog2008"]]

When I add a blog post, I see it on the wiki but it doesn't appear on `History` or `RecentChanges`. If I run `hg status` on the wiki source dir, I see the new file has been marked as `A` (ie, a new file that has not been commited).

If I then edit the blog post, **then** the file gets commited and I can see the edit on `History` and `RecentChanges`. The creation of the file remains unrecorded.  --[[buo]]

>>>> (Sorry for the delay, I was AFK for a while.) What I am seeing is this: in a non-utf8 locale, using mercurial "stand-alone" (no ikiwiki involved), mercurial fails to commit if the commit message has characters such as á. If the locale is utf8, mercurial works fine (this is with mercurial 1.0).

>>>> However, the part that seems a bit wrong to me, is this: even if my locale is utf8, I have to explicitly set a utf8 locale in the wiki's setup file, or the commit fails. It looks like ikiwiki is not using this machine's default locale, which is utf8. Also, I'm not getting any errors on apache's error log.
