Joey, please see RecentChanges and note that this is my second bug report,
because the first was unsuccessfully (bad characters in post title?).
Could you please tidy it up?

I've just upgraded my ikiwiki from version 2.11 to the latest version 2.15.
I use my own rebuilt ikiwiki package for Ubuntu Gutsy box. Now I can't rebuild
all my ikiwiki pages, because of the following bug:

    ptecza@anahaim:~/blog$ ikiwiki --setup ikiwiki.setup --getctime --verbose
    [...]
    scanning post/2007/12/09/pink-freud-w-cafe-kulturalna.mdwn
    ikiwiki.setup: Insecure dependency in mkdir while running with -T switch at /usr/share/perl5/IkiWiki.pm line 355.
    BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at (eval 5) line 151.

I have a write permission to the ikiwiki destination directory:

    ptecza@anahaim:~/blog$ ls -ld /var/www/blog/
    drwxr-xr-x 2 ptecza ptecza 4096 2007-12-17 10:48 /var/www/blog/

I've read ikiwiki changelog for the previous releases and unfortunately
I can't see any related entries. Any ideas?

>> Thanks for your efforts, Joey! I sent my `ikiwiki.setup` file to you.
