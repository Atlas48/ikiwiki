Steps to reproduce:

1. visit an ikiwki site like <http://ikiwiki.info/> or <http://git-annex.branchable.com/>
2. trigger the login page by accessing preferences or trying to edit something
3. login page is served without encryption

Firefox gives all kinds of warnings for unencrypted login pages.

The fix is for the login page to redirect to the https version of the wiki before showing the login form.
