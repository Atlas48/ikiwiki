It doesn't happen on ikiwiki.info but on my site if I enter any of the fancy typography characeters (“,”,…, etc) then when I save the page they are displayed as garbage characters.    I've put an example at the top of [this page](http://adam.shand.net/iki/2007/Test_for_possible_ikiwiki_bug.html?updated).

Sorry, I know the title is ridiculously vague for a bug but I don't know what the proper name the fancy typography characters are. :-/
