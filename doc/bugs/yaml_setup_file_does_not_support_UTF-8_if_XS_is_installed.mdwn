I converted an ikiwiki setup file to YAML as
[[documented|tips/yaml_setup_files]].

On my Debian Squeeze system, attempting to build the wiki using the
YAML setup file triggers the following error message:

	YAML::XS::Load Error: The problem:

	    Invalid trailing UTF-8 octet

	was found at document: 0
	usage: ikiwiki [options] source dest
	       ikiwiki --setup configfile

Indeed, my setup file contains UTF-8 characters.

Deinstalling YAML::XS ([[!debpkg libyaml-libyaml-perl]]) resolves this
issue. According to YAML::Any's POD, YAML::Syck is used instead of
YAML::XS in this case since it's the best YAML implementaion available
on my system.

No encoding-related setting is mentionned in YAML::XS' POD. We may
consider there is a bug in there. I'll see if it's known / fixed
somewhere as soon as I get online.

Joey, as a (hopefully) temporary workaround, what do you think of
explicitely using YAML::Syck (or whatever other YAML implementation
that does not expose this bug) rather than letting YAML::Any pick its
preferred one?
