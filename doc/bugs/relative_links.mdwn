It looks like all links in websites are absolute paths, this has some limitations:

* If connecting to website via https://... all links will take you back to http://
* Makes it harder to mirror website via HTML version, as all links have to be updated.

It would be good if relative paths could be used instead, so the transport method isn't changed unless specifically requested.

>> Something weird going on here, most of the links *are* relative. Maybe I was just too rushed. However there are still problems:

>> Links at the top of the edit page; they are absolute (understandably). e.g. at the top of this page there is the header "ikiwiki/ editing bugs/relative links" where ikiwiki is an absolute link to the top of the page.

>> If I push cancel on the edit page, I end up at http://..., although I am not sure how this occurs.
