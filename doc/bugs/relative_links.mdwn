It looks like all links in websites are absolute paths, this has some limitations:

* If connecting to website via https://... all links will take you back to http://
* Makes it harder to mirror website via HTML version, as all links have to be updated.

It would be good if relative paths could be used instead, so the transport method isn't changed unless specifically requested.

>> The problem is within the CGI script. The links within the HTML page are all absolute, including links to the css file.
>> Having a http links within a HTML page retrieved using https upset most browsers (I think). Also if I push cancel on the edit page in https, I end up at at http page. -- Brian May
