when using the [[img plugin|plugins/img]] with an svg file, it is supposed to
convert it into a png for display in all browsers, and because the typical use
case is rendering small preview versions.

this currently doesn't work (at least with graphicsmagick-libmagick-dev-compat
1.3.18-1) due to the sequence imagemagick options are set, needs an extension
to work for pdfs (or any other imagemagick compatibile file) too, and should
have an additional parameter for page selection.

i've provided a series of [[!taglink patch]]es in the chrysn/imgforpdf [[git]]
branch.

i'd prefer to go a step further, and not only convert pdf and svg files to png,
but everything (with the possible exception of jpg files), as most other image
formats can't be displayed in a browser anyway.
