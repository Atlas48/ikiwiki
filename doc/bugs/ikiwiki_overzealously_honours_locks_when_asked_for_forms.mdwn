When an `ikiwiki` instance is holding a lock, a web user clicking on "add comment" (for example) will have to wait for the lock to be released.  However, all they are then presented with is a web form.  Perhaps CGI requests that are read-only (such as generating a comment form, or perhaps certain types of edits) should ignore locks? Of course, I'd understand that the submission would need to wait for a lock. â€” [[Jon]]
