After several runs of ikiwiki --refresh, the page I use with the [[plugin/brokenlinks]] directive on it accumulates multiple repeated lists of pages on the RHS. For example:

 * ?freebies from free kilowatts, free kilowatts, free kilowatts, free kilowatts, free kilowatts

In this case the page "free kilowatts" has one link to "freebies" (it's tagged freebies).

I think this may just be links caused by tags, actually.

ikiwiki version 3.14159265.
