The search result page uses a wrong path for the css files.

This is, because the search plugin provides $config{cgiurl} as
basepath to the misc template. And so the path to the css 
files ends up to be "$config{cgiurl}/local.css". But this is
wrong if $config{cgiurl} is not the same as $config{url}.
