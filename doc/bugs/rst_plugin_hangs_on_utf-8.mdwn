When rendering an rst page with utf-8 characters in (specifically "Â£"), ikiwiki seems to hang.

Killing with Control-C gives the following traceback:

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/usr/lib/ikiwiki/plugins/rst", line 97, in ?
        handler.handle_request()
      File "/usr/lib/ikiwiki/plugins/rst", line 74, in handle_request
        ret = rpc_read(processor)
      File "/usr/lib/ikiwiki/plugins/rst", line 42, in rpc_read
        line = sys.stdin.readline()
    KeyboardInterrupt

rst2html on the same file has no problem rendering the file as expected.
