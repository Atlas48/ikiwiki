Is there any way to get IkiWiki to take a file's Last Edited date from its mtime?

I have a bunch of pages that have been imported from another wiki.  For some reason, their Last Edited date is today, the day they were imported, even though the file's mtime is correctly set to two years ago.  It's important that these files have the correct Last Edited date so that nobody thinks that they're new.  They're horribly stale and I'd like that to be very obvious.  :)

How can I accomplish this in IkiWiki?
