* Has bugs updating things if the bestlink of a page changes due to
  adding/removing a page. For example, if Foo/Bar links to "Baz", which is
  Foo/Baz, and Foo/Bar/Baz gets added, it will update the links in Foo/Bar
  to point to it, but will forget to update the linkbacks in Foo/Baz.

* And if Foo/Bar/Baz is then removed, it forgets to update Foo/Bar to link
  back to Foo/Baz.

    -- is this still true? (Yes (as of 1.0))
