ikiwiki 1.45 doesn't work properly for perl installs not in the system path.

ie:

~/tools/perl-5.8.8/perl Makefile.PL
make

fails, as the 'make' command attempts to use the perl install in PATH, rather than the one ikiwiki is being installed for.

The installed bin/ikiwiki file also refers to /usr/bin/perl rather than the perl it is being installed for.
