On some ikiwikis that I run, I get the following error on OpenID logins:

    no_identity_server: Could not determine ID provider from URL.

I seem recall having that error before, and fixing it, but it always seems to come back and I forget how to fix it. So I'll just open this bug and document it if i can figure it out... -- [[users/anarcat]]
