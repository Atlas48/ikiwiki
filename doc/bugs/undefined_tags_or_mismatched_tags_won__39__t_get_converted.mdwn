If you put in something such as undefined tags or mismatched tags in .mdwn file, ikiwiki will put &lt;p>&lt;/p> around them. But ikiwiki will NOT convert < and > to &amp;lt; and &amp;gt;! 

     <section>

     some text

     </section>


the output html

    <p><section></p> <p>some text</p> <p></section></p> 

And another example of mismatched tags:



     <div>

     some text

     </div>
     </div>


The out put is:

    <div>

    some text

    </div>

    <p></div></p>
