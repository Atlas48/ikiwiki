I suppose this isn't technically a bug, but whetever.

I want symbolic links to be rendered as HTTP redirects. For example,
if we do this,

```
touch foo.mkdwn
ln -s foo.mkdwn bar.mkdwn
git push baz.branchable.com
```

then the following command should print 302

```
curl -o /dev/null -s -w "%{http_code}" http://wiki.thomaslevine.com
```
