The inline plugin appears to ignore some pages. In the Ion FAQ I have the pages `Window_flashing_case_1.mdwn` and `Window_flashing_case_2.mdwn`. Only the first one is included in inlines. If I rename the latter to `Window_flashing_case_two.mdwn`, both are included. It seems like there's on off-by-one problem in name comparison or something like that.. --tuomov
