ikiwiki's map directive is full of surprises. I have put a snapshot of the
site as it was when I saw the following problem at
<http://scratch.madduck.net/web__phd.martin-krafft.net__map-bug-2.tgz> and can
revert there any time, but I need to move on.

I have a few tags starting with `a` (abridged list):

    $ ls wiki/factors/tag/a*
    [...]
    wiki/factors/tag/active/:
    index.html
    
    wiki/factors/tag/affects/:
    contributors/  developers/  users/
    [...]

In `wiki-wc/factors/tag.mdwn`, I have a map for these tags:

    [[map pages="factors/tag/*"]]

and this works, except that for *whatever* reason, it actually sorts the three
`affects/*` tags under `active`:

    $ w3m -dump wiki/factors/tag/index.html | grep active -A3
                  ○ active
                      ■ contributors
                      ■ developers
                      ■ users

This really blows my mind. :)
