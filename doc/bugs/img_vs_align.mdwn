The *[[ikiwiki/directive/img]]* directive allows for specifying an
*align* parameter -- which is of limited usability as the image is
embedded as `<p><img ...></p>`.  That's at least what I see on
<http://www.bddebian.com:8888/~hurd-web/hurd/status/>.  On the other
hand, CSS is supposed to be used instead, I guess.  (But how...  I forgot
almost of my CSS foo again ;-) it seems.) --[[tschwinge]]
