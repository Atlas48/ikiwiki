I've noticed that Ikiwiki displays URLs with parentheses badly. The problem occurs
in the latest version 3.00 and older versions. Please look at the link to following
Polish entry about C programming language at Wikipedia (it seems that URLs with
parentheses are popular there):

[Język programowania C](http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(j%C4%99zyk_programowania))

I need to escape a closing parenthesis of the URL to fix the problem.

[Język programowania C](http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(j%C4%99zyk_programowania\))
