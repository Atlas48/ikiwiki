[[!tag patch]]
[[!template id=gitbranch branch=smcv/ready/no-tags author="[[smcv]]"]]

The `gitremotes` script picks up tags from any repository, including those
used for local .debs that were never actually present in Debian:

    smcv@reptile% git tag | grep -c nmu
    52

This can be avoided with the `tagopt = --no-tags` option in .git/config;
