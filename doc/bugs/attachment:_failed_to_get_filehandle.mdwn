I can't add any attachment to my wiki. When I select file using "Browse"
button and click "Upload Attachment", then `ikiwiki.cgi` file displays
the error message like below:

    Błąd: failed to get filehandle

> Can you do some debugging? If you edit attachment.pm line 136, to print

	error("failed to get filehandle ($fh)");

>> Sure. I've done the change and it seems that $fh variable is undefined:

>>     Use of uninitialized value in concatenation (.) or string at /usr/share/perl5/IkiWiki/Plugin/attachment.pm line 135.
>>     failed to get filehandle ()

>> It's Apache2 2.2.8-1ubuntu0.3 and Perl 5.8.8-12 from Ubuntu Hardy. --[[Paweł|ptecza]]

>>> Hmm, is your CGI.pm perhaps creating the attachment temp file, but

	error("failed to get filehandle:$fh ; file:$filename ; is ref:".ref($q->param('attachment')));

The same message I can see in the Apache log file. There is also
following warning:

    Use of uninitialized value in length at /usr/share/perl5/IkiWiki/Plugin/attachment.pm line 36.

> This is unrelated, I've fixed the warning message. --[[Joey]]

Is it Ikiwiki bug or my attachment plugin is misconfigured? --[[Paweł|ptecza]]

> Joey, please fix the colon in page name of my report. [...]

>> Moved to [[colon:problem]] --[[Joey]]
