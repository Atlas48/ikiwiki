I can't add any attachment to my wiki. When I select file using "Browse"
button and click "Upload Attachment", then `ikiwiki.cgi` file displays
the error message like below:

    Błąd: failed to get filehandle

The same message I can see in the Apache log file. There is also
following warning:

    Use of uninitialized value in length at /usr/share/perl5/IkiWiki/Plugin/attachment.pm line 36.

Is it Ikiwiki bug or my attachment plugin is misconfigured? --[[Paweł|ptecza]]
