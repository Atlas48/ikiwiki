I've just noticed that `attachment` plugin esacapes underscore characters
in attached filenames. For example, when I wanted to add
`foo_bar_baz.txt` file, then Ikiwiki added file `foo__95__bar__95__baz.txt`
to my Subversion repo. I hope that the filename is terribly ugly not only
for me ;)

Is it a bug or security feature? --[[Pawe≈Ç|ptecza]]
