I've set `wiki_file_chars` to a non-standard value in the setup file:

    wiki_file_chars => "-[:alnum:]+/.:_\x{1f310}\x{1f430}",

(In case you're wondering, [this is the page](http://xn--9dbdkw.se/🌐/).)

ikiwiki recognises my pages when I run it from the command line, but
when I edit something through the CGI "script", ikiwiki would suddenly
not recognise them.

By running `strings` on the CGI wrapper I found that the option
`wiki_file_regexp` was still at its original setting.  So as a workaround,
I added this to the setup file and everything worked:

    wiki_file_regexp => qr/(^[-[:alnum:]+\/.:_\x{1f310}\x{1f430}]+$)/,

Maybe the CGI wrapper should specially call `checkconfig`, which is
the function responsible for updating `wiki_file_regexp`?
