#Ikiwiki plugin for the Monotone revision control system.

I've just made a patch to the ikiwiki code that allows it to use the [Monotone](http://monotone.ca/) revision control system.  It is available at:

<http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~willu/monotone-ikiwiki.diff>

At the moment it supports basic committing and listing recent changes.  It does not support rcs_notify() or rcs_getctime() yet.  Moreover,
while there is support for simultaneous commits (e.g. conflicts), it is untested and if it happens to work would leave the repository in an unmerged state.

But it is better than nothing.
