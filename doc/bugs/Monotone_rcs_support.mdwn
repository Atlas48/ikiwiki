#Ikiwiki plugin for the Monotone revision control system.

I've just made a patch to the ikiwiki code that allows it to use the [Monotone](http://monotone.ca/) revision control system.  It is available at:

<http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~willu/monotone-ikiwiki.diff>

At the moment it supports basic committing and listing recent changes.  It implements rcs_notify() and rcs_getctime(), but they're untested.  Moreover,
while there is support for simultaneous commits, any conflicts leave the repository in an unmerged state which has to be cleaned up using the non-web
monotone interface.  The user's data is still stored, and the user is informed if this happens.

> The conflict issue seems like the main problem. I might just add it to ikiwiki and mark is as experimental and known buggy though. :-) --[[Joey]]

Note: This patch requires the Monotone perl module, which is only available in Monotone 0.36 or later.  The module is in the Monotone contrib/ directory.  While 0.36 is relatively new, that Monotone module itself will work with a monotone binary back quite a few releases.

Apparently this module did't make some versions of the monotone 0.36 release tarball.  It is available from the monotone repository here: <http://viewmtn.angrygoats.net/branch/changes/net.venge.monotone>.
