I have a mobile setup of ikiwiki.

* On my server, I set up an ikiwiki + svn
* On my laptop, I did a check out of the svn and used it as the src of a local ikiwiki (local apache server)

I wanted to be able to change my wiki off line with cgi only, and just commit as I come back online.

During the laptop setup, I think that the setup was confused by the fact that my src directory is a versionned one.
I had to setup explicitely rcs = "" to force it to work the way I wanted.

Should it be documented ?
