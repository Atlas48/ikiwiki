Indented lines provide a good way to escape a block of text containing
markdown syntax, but ikiwiki links like \[[this]] are still
interpreted within such a block. I think that intepretation should not
be happening. That is I should be able to write:

	[[this]]

and have it render like:

	\[[this]]
