Don't panic, Joey! ;) It's not a bug. It's only my small wish :)

Could you also please convert "somehost.com/user" OpenID to
"user [somehost.com]" at RecentChanges page? You just do it
for "user.somehost.com" OpenIDs. I think that same display form
for all OpenIDs is a good idea. What's your opinion?

BTW, Happy New Year for you and Debian 'etch' and all ikiwiki
users! :) --Pawel
