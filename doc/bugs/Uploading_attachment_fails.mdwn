I just upgraded from ubuntu 14.04 to ubuntu 15.04. Since then uploading attachments using the attachment plugin doesn't work anymore in ikiwiki. Any idea what may be wrong here and how to fix it?

ikiwiki version 3.20141016.2

`/var/log/apache2/error.log`

gives this:

Died at `/usr/share/perl5/IkiWiki/CGI.pm line 497`.
