I've got a wiki where editing requires [[plugins/httpauth]] (with
`cgiauthurl` working nicely). I now want to let the general public
edit Discussion subpages, so I enabled [[plugins/anonok]] and set
`anonok_pagespec` to `'*/Discussion'`, but HTTP auth is still being
required for those.

(Actually, what I'll really want to do is probably [[plugins/lockedit]]
and a whitelist of OpenIDs in `locked_pages`...)
