The edit page CGI defines a `base` tag with an URL which is not
absolute, which can break the preview function in some circumstances
(with e.g. images not showing). The trivial [[patch]] that fixes
it can be found [[here|http://sprunge.us/EPHT]] as well as on [[my
git|http://git.oblomov.eu/ikiwiki]].
