[[!tag patch]]

As noted in the Try::Tiny man page, eval/$@ can be quite awkward in
corner cases, because $@ has the same properties and problems as C's
errno. While writing a regression test for definetemplate
in which it couldn't find an appropriate template, I received
    
    <span class="error">Error: failed to process template
    <span class="createlink">deftmpl</span> </span>
    
instead of the intended
    
    <span class="error">Error: failed to process template
    <span class="createlink">deftmpl</span> template deftmpl not
    found</span>
    
which turned out to be because the "catch"-analogous block called
gettext before it used $@, and gettext can call define_gettext,
which uses eval.

Fixed in my branch smcv/ready/careful-eval. --[[smcv]]
