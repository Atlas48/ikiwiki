By default, tflag is not defined. But ikiwiki.in has -T causing build failure:

perl -Iblib/lib   ikiwiki.out -libdir . -setup docwiki.setup -refresh
"-T" is on the #! line, it must also be used on the command line at ikiwiki.out
line 1.

> pm_filter removes the -T from ikiwiki.in when generating ikiwiki.out
