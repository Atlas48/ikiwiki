I've just upgraded my Ikiwiki to backported version 2.64 for Ubuntu Hardy
and wanted to see progress bar in action. Unfortunately, I can't see any progress.

This is my example Ikiwiki syntax:

    [[!progress percent=75]]

A here is a HTML result:

    <div class="progress">
      <div class="progress-done"></div>
    </div>

It seems that progress plugin works at all, but it's a problem with passing
progress value.

Anyone can confirm the bug? --[[Pawe≈Ç|ptecza]]
