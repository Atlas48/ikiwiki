[[this feature|todo/syslog_should_show_wiki_name]] made it so syslog doesn't work anymore if the site being logged has non-ASCII characters it in.

Specifically, my wiki was named "Câ’¶TS", and nothing was showing up in syslog. When I changed that to "C@TS", it worked again.

My guess is this sits somewhere here:

[[!format perl """
		return eval {
			Sys::Syslog::syslog($type, "[$config{wikiname}] %s", join(" ", @_));
		};
"""]]

Yet I am not sure how to fix that kind of problem in Perl... --[[anarcat]]
