Calling ikiwiki with a bunch of options, including the `--dumpsetup somefile.setup` option creates `somefile.setup` for later reuse with the `--setup` option. The wiki state dir however is not saved in the setup file, it has no `wikistatedir` at all.

Strange since same [[kind of bugs|bugs/dumpsetup_does_not_save_destdir]] have been fixed for `destdir`.
