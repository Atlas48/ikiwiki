Since upgrading from Ikiwiki 2.20 to 2.32.3 (from Debian Lenny), I don't get hyperlinks to items which have a colon in their name anymore. This applies to both the normal and the archive view. Before the update, the links have been created as relative links, so they weren't usable either as the browser tried to take the part before the colon as protocol specification (as in e.g. `http:`). Iirc, this applied to the archive view only, links in the normal view were ok (will check this out again if it's important). Is there a way to quote each colon as %xy in the hyperlinks? Perhaps it's only a problem with my config, and not an actual bug...?

EDIT: I just found that in this wiki under <http://ikiwiki.info/bugs/done/> the entry "mailto: links not properly generated in rss/atom feeds" also doesn't have a hyperlink - at least it's not a problem with my config only ;-)

[[madduck]]: I can confirm this on my own wiki.
