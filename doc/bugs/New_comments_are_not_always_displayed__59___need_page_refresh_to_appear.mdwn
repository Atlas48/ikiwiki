I noticed this a few times in Google Chrome 12 (dev channel) a few times, already:

I added a comment to 

    http://git-annex.branchable.com/forum/performance_improvement:_git_on_ssd__44___annex_on_spindle_disk/

and left the page. Later, I revisited

    http://git-annex.branchable.com/forum/

and clicked on

    http://git-annex.branchable.com/forum/performance_improvement:_git_on_ssd__44___annex_on_spindle_disk/

My own comment did not appear. I pressed F5 and eh presto.

My assumption is that ikiwiki does not tell Chrome to reload the page as the cache is stale.
