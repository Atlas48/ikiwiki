I know this sounds backwards, but it seems to me that the KML-generated map should be displayable on google maps. KML is the standard Google uses for google maps, and since we use it, we should interoperate with them. God knows why this is failing, but it is and should probably be fixed for the sake of interoperability: <https://maps.google.ca/maps?q=http:%2F%2Fwiki.reseaulibre.ca%2Fmap%2Fpois.kml> -- [[users/anarcat]]

The KML only needs a Document tag because it uses "shared styles" -- don't ask me what this is. Here is a [[patch]]: [[https://reseaulibre.deuxpi.ca/0001-Add-Document-tag-to-OSM-plugin-KML-output.patch]] --[[deuxpi]]
