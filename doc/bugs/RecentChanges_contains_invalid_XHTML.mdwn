The final `</div>` in [`recentchanges.tmpl`][tmpl] gets wrapped in a
`<p>` tag for some reason, resulting in the following invalid XHTML at
the end of the [[RecentChanges]] page

    <p></div></p>

Also, there is a problem with the `<img>` tags generated by the smiley
plugin which end up wrapped in a `<pre>` tag in the inline diff output.
`<img>` tags is not allowed within a `<pre>` block.  Maybe the smiley
plugin should be disabled on [[RecentChanges]]?

See the [validator output][validate] for more details.

I'll add this here since it's related.  I also noticed that the meta tags for
redirected pages need to be closed in order to be valid XHTML:

    <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="10; URL=../ikiwiki/pagespec/">

I'm noticing these problems because I'm serving ikiwiki-generated
content as `application/xhtml+xml` (as opposed to `text/html`) in order
to include inline MathML.  Any invalid XHTML causes Firefox to halt all
processing and throw an error. &mdash;[Jason Blevins](http://jblevins.org/)
