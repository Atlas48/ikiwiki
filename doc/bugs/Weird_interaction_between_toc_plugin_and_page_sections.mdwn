<http://vcs-pkg.org/people/> goes really weird when I enable the `toc` plugin. It renders the page sections fine without it, but as soon as I turn it on, the following output is generated:

    \[[!meta  title="My Name"]]

      1. Fedora
      2. Ubuntu
      3. People grouped by version control system
      4. GNU Arch (tla/baz)
      5. Bazaar-NG
      6. Git users
      7. Mercurial
      8. Subversion
      9. Everyone, sorted by first name

    People grouped by distro ======================== Debian ––

        * jelmer
        * madduck

    Fedora

I have no idea what's eating the first two headers.

--[[madduck]]
