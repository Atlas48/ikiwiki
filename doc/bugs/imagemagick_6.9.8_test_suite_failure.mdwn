we've recently updated Imagemagick in NixOS from version 6.9.7-6 to
6.9.8-4, and this change causes the Ikiwiki test suite to fail in
t/img.t, like so:

	#   Failed test at t/img.t line 119.
	#          got: 'no image'
	#     expected: '10x10'

	#   Failed test at t/img.t line 129.
	#          got: 'no image'
	#     expected: '12x12'

	#   Failed test at t/img.t line 130.
	#          got: 'no image'
	#     expected: '16x2'

	#   Failed test at t/img.t line 134.
	#          got: 'no image'
	#     expected: '8x8'

	#   Failed test at t/img.t line 135.
	#          got: 'no image'
	#     expected: '4x4'

	#   Failed test at t/img.t line 136.
	#          got: 'no image'
	#     expected: '6x6'

	#   Failed test at t/img.t line 138.
	#          got: 'no image'
	#     expected: '11x11'

	#   Failed test at t/img.t line 139.
	#          got: 'no image'
	#     expected: '12x12'

	#   Failed test at t/img.t line 140.
	#          got: 'no image'
	#     expected: '13x13'
	# Looks like you failed 9 tests of 62.
	t/img.t ........................
	Dubious, test returned 9 (wstat 2304, 0x900)
	Failed 9/62 subtests

Is this is a known problem and is there maybe a fix for this issue?
