Some elements of [HTML5](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/) can be safely supported by ikiwiki. There are [several differences between HTML4 and HTMl5](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5-diff/). Unsupported new elements _should degrade gracefully_.

However as an [early adopter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_adopter) I would like to start using HTML5 as much as possible. The more pragmatic solution would be to use elements supported by the browsers of your readership I guess. I'm following other early adopters like [Anne](http://annevankesteren.nl/) for clues on how to proceed.

I'm unsure how to turn off the test validation by the very old [wdg-html-validator](http://packages.qa.debian.org/w/wdg-html-validator.html). So I have been unable to test my initial patches as I can't build ikiwiki. I would like to know how to edit the rules/Makefile to temporarily disable this.

[validator.nu](http://validator.nu/) incidentally is **the** HTML5 validator, however it is almost impossible to sanely introduce as a build dependency because of its insane Java requirements. :( I test locally via [cURL](http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/IDE), though Debian packages cannot be built with a network dependency.

# Notes

* the [time element](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-time-element) ideally needs the datatime= attribute set with iso8601 time
* I suspect the migration to the new semantic elements of HTML5 like article, header & footer to take some time, due to browser support. Though they sure make the template code look much nicer.
* `<br>` and too many `<div>`s usually indicates poor semantics.
  > YMMV, but I tend to find that kind of concern counterproductive.
  > --[[Joey]] 
* Many of the header `<span>`s should be proper [header elements](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/semantics.html#the-h1,-h2,-h3,-h4,-h5,-and-h6-elements)
  > See [[todo/Option_to_make_title_an_h1__63__]] for why not. --[[Joey]]
