There is (on a sufficiently small display) a large free spacing between the
*vmstat* line and the first *Posted* line.
Even without any `local.css`.
This is because of `clear: both` in ikiwiki's `style.css`, line 109,
for `.pagedate, .pagelicense, .pagecopyright`.

I can override this in `local.css`, but what was the original reason for
adding this `clear: both`?
