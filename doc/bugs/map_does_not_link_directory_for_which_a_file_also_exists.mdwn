On <http://phd.martin-krafft.net/wiki/tag/factors/>, the top-level `factors` entry is not linked to the corresponding page. Looking at <http://phd.martin-krafft.net/wiki/tag/factors/language/>, this must be because the page name is the same as the entry name, and ikiwiki probably doesn't take the complete path of subpages into account.
