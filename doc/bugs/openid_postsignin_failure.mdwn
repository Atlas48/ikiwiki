I tried enabling the openid plugin on my site. I tried to log in but got an 
error when coming back to ikiwiki.cgi: "Error: unknown do parameter". I think
this means that do=postsignin isn't handled by CGI.pm. 

The URI in question is fairly long, but if you want me to add it here, I can do that.

I didn't really know how to debug this so I grepped for "postsignin" in both 
openid.pm and passwordauth.pm and found:

    IkiWiki/Plugin/openid.pm:               return_to => IkiWiki::cgiurl(do => "postsignin"),
    IkiWiki/Plugin/passwordauth.pm:                         IkiWiki::cgi_postsignin($cgi, $session);

Am I barking up the wrong tree? Maybe I'm missing something obvious? 

I'm running 1.38 of ikiwiki and the newest CGI::Session, Net::OpenID::Consumer, 
Crypt::DH, URI-Fetch. --Ethan
