I have a private ikiwiki (3.20170111) which is running on a host that serves HTTP and HTTPS, but ikiwiki is configured for (and only served on) HTTPS:

    url: https://<redacted>/phd/
    cgiurl: https://<redacted>/phd/cgi

However, form submissions from ikiwiki are going to a HTTP URL and thus not being served. Example headers from submitting a comment:

```
Request URL:https://<redacted>/phd/cgi
Request Method:POST
Status Code:302 Found
Remote Address:<redacted>:443
Referrer Policy:no-referrer-when-downgrade

Response Headers
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Server: nginx/1.10.3
Date: Fri, 08 Dec 2017 11:53:35 GMT
Content-Length: 0
Connection: keep-alive
Status: 302 Found
Location: http://<redacted>/phd/blog/38th_Dec/?updated#comment-bd0549eb2464b5ca0544f68e6c32221e
```

The CGI is served by lighttpd, but the whole site is front-ended by nginx, which reverse-proxies to lighttpd.
