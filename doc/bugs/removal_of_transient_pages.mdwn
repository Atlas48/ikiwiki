This is particularly a problem for tag pages, and autoindex
created pages. So both plugins default to not creating transient
pages, until this is fixed.  --[[Joey]]

[[!template id=gitbranch branch=smcv/ready/transient-rm author="[[Simon McVittie|smcv]]"]]

Here's a branch. It special-cases the `$transientdir`, but in such a way
that the special case could easily be extended to other locations where
deletion should be allowed.

It also changes `IkiWiki::prune()` to optionally stop pruning empty
parent directories at the point where you'd expect it to (for instance,
previously it would remove the `$transientdir` itself, if it turns out
to be empty), and updates callers.

The new `prune` API looks like this:

    IkiWiki::prune("$config{srcdir}/$file", $config{srcdir});

with the second argument optional. I wonder whether it ought to look
more like `writefile`:

    IkiWiki::prune($config{srcdir}, $file);

although that would be either an incompatible change to internal API
(forcing all callers to update to 2-argument), or being a bit
inconsistent between the one-and two-argument forms. Thoughts?
