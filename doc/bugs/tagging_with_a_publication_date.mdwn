Feature idea: I'd like to be able to tag pages in an ikiwiki blog with a publication date, and have the option of building a blog that excludes publication dates in the future.  (meta pubdate= ?)
 
I'm using ikiwiki on git for a "tip of the day" RSS feed, and I'd like to be able to queue up a bunch of items instead of literally putting in one tip per day.  In the future I think this will come in handy for other Mainstream Media-oriented requirements such as "embargo dates" and "editor on vacation".
