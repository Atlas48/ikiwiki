I tried to make the [[plugin_template|templates/plugin]] automatically add the
`type/core` tag if passed the `core` parameter.  However, this did not appear
to have the desired effect: if I removed `type/core` from the tags on a plugin
page that used `core=1` in the template (such as [[plugins/mdwn]]), the
`type/core` tag disappeared, and the template did not supply
it. --[[JoshTriplett]]
