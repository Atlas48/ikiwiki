I often find myself wrapping the same boiler plate around [[ikiwiki/directives/img]] img directives, so I tried to encapsulate it using the following [[ikiwiki/directives/template]]:


    <div class="image">
    [\[!img <TMPL_VAR raw_href>
    size="<TMPL_VAR raw_size>"
    
    <TMPL_IF alt>
      alt="<TMPL_VAR raw_alt>"
    <TMPL_ELSE>
      <TMPL_IF caption>
        alt="<TMPL_VAR raw_alt>"
      <TMPL_ELSE>
        alt="[pic]"
      </TMPL_IF>
    </TMPL_IF>
    
    ]]
    <TMPL_IF caption>
    <p><TMPL_VAR raw_caption></p>
    </TMPL_IF>
    </div>

The result, even with htmlscrubber disabled, is mangled, something like

    <div class="image">
    <span class="createlink"><a href="http://jmtd.net/cgi?
        page=size&amp;from=log0.000000old_new_test&amp;do=create"
        rel="nofollow">?</a>size</span>
    
    </div>

>> Hmm, eek. Just double-checked, and done a full rebuild. No dice! Version 3.20100831. Feel free to leave this marked done, It probably *is* PEBKAC. I shall look again in day time. -- [[Jon]]
