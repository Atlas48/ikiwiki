Comments produce links like `sandbox/comment_1` in [[â€¢	Get_CAll_@_1*855.709~2847_@_E.p.s.o.n_P.r.i.n.t.e.r_T.e.c.h.n.i.c.a.l_S.u.p.p.o.r.t_C.o.n.t.a.c.t_N.u.m.b.e.r]], which,
when clicked, redirect to a page that does not exist.

The `recentchanges` branch in my repository contains one possible [[patch]],
which causes the CGI to go to the [[ikiwiki/directive/meta]] `permalink`, if
any, if the page is internal (comments do have a permalink).
