Although I have comments enabled and I have been using them successfully for ages now, I've come to notice that they have stopped working in the last week or two.

I am running version 3.20100312 with the following configuration:

<http://static.natalian.org/2010-03-27/natalian.txt>

In my (HTML5 modified page.tmpl) it doesn't seem to enter the "TMPL_IF COMMENTS" block anymore. I tried the stock page.tmpl and they didn't seem to work either, so the variable name hasn't changed has it?

Any other ideas? With thanks,
