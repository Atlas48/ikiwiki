When I renamed `todo/transient_in-memory_pages` to [[todo/transient pages]],
`rename::fixlinks` was meant to blame me for the link-fixing commit, and title it
`update for rename of %s to %s`. Instead, it blamed Joey for the commit,
and didn't set a commit message.

(It also committed a pile of recentchanges pages which shouldn't have
been committed, for which see [[bugs/git_commit_adds_files_that_were_not_tracked]].)
