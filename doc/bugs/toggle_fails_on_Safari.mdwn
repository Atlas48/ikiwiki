The [[plugins/toggle]] plugin has no effect when viewed on the Safari web browser.

All toggles appear open all the time.

I don't know if this is true for other webkit browsers (the new Konqeror, the iPhone, etc).
I'm currently testing in the Safari nightly builds, but I've seen the bug in the current release
of Safari too.

Looking at the Safari Wed Inspector, it believes there is a parse error on line 47 of the
[[news]] page.  This is the definition of the getElementsByClass(class) function.

    45 }
    46
    47 function getElementsByClass(class) {
       SyntaxError: Parse error
    48 	var ret = new Array();
