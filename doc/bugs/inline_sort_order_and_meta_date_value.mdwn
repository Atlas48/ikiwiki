I have a directory containing two files. f1 (<http://alcopop.org/~jon/repro/src/2008/07/02/debgtd.html>) has 

    meta date="2008-07-02 14:13:17"

f2 (<http://alcopop.org/~jon/repro/src/2008/07/02/moving.html>) has

    meta date="2008-07-02 21:04:21"

They have both been modified recently:

    >>> stat(f1)
    (33188, 459250L, 65027L, 1, 1000, 1000, 1686L, 1227967177, 1227966706, 1227966706)
    >>> stat(f2)
    (33188, 458868L, 65027L, 1, 1000, 1000, 938L, 1227967187, 1227966705, 1227966705)

Note that f1 is fractionally newer than f2 in terms of ctime and mtime, but f2 is much newer in terms of the meta information.

Another page includes them both via inline. The inclusion pagespec is not based on date, but on path (and the files are sorted into directories based on their dates)

    inline pages="2008/07/*/*" show=5

The resulting page is rendered with f1 above f2, seemingly not using the meta directive information: <http://alcopop.org/~jon/repro/dest/2008/07/>. The footer in the inline pages does use the correct time e.g. <em>Posted Wed 02 Jul 2008 14:13:17 BST</em>.

If I instead include them using creation_year in the pagespec, they are ordered correctly.

<http://alcopop.org/~jon/repro/> contains the src used to reproduce this, the precise ikiwiki invocation (inside Makefile) and the results (dest).
