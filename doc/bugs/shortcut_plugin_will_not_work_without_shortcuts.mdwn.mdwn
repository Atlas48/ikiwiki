On my initial ikiwiki -setup auto.setup, I get the following error:

    shortcut plugin will not work without shortcuts.mdwn
    /home/turian/utils/etc/ikiwiki/auto.setup: ikiwiki --refresh --setup /home/turian/iki.setup failed at IkiWiki/Setup/Automator.pm line 105.


This is using the latest git pull of ikiwiki.
I am not sure why it is not finding shortcuts.mdwn. -- [[JosephTurian]]
