Hi, I try to make an example to reproduce some bug with inline and toc plugins.
My friend uses 
\[[inline pages="users/joey" raw="yes"]]
to include common snippets in various pages, and it works as advertised, but if toc plugin is used, page is messed up.

I'll try here to reproduce one example...

You can see that wikilink is rendered in one line and 'here's paragraph' is not a separate paragraph.

All this is displayed correctly if toc is removed.

[[wikilink|users]]

Here's a paragraph.
