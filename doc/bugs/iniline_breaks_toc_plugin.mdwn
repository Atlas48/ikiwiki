Hi, I try to make an example to reproduce some bug with inline and toc plugins.
My friend uses 
[[inline pages="users/joey" raw="yes"]]
to include common snippets in various pages, and it works as advertised, but if toc plugin is used, page is messed up.

I'll try here to reproduce one example...

[[inline pages="users/joey" raw="yes"]]
