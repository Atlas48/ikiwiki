I am trying to add a post address to a document:

<address>
  First line<br/>
  Second line
</address>

As you can see, the `<br/>` is being removed. I disabled [[htmlscrubber]], but that was not it. The [markdown Dingus](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus) on its homepage processes the inline HTML just fine.

I tried searching the web and wiki but could not find any information on why <br/> would be removed.
