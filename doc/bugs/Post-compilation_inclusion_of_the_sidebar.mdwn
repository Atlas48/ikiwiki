In some sites (mine, for example), the pages are quasi-static, while the sidebar must be updated at each commit
(because it contains some lists, like "last posts" or "last updates", or a tagcloud). As this sidebar is included
in every page of the site, many commits can potentialy leat to a full re-compilation....

I think a sidebar included after the compilation (via a SSI mechanism for example) would make sense and 
reduce the dependencies.

Different things could be possible:

* output as .shtml instead of .html
* ignore the sidebar->page dependency links
* consider the *real* dependencies; pageA may include the title (only) of pageB, but don't need to be recompiled 
after each typo correction on pageB.

shtml output with open cgi web access is a potential security hole and can DoS the site, but it's not a problem for a 
single-editor site.
