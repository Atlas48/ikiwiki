When I use my OpenID, http://thewordnerd.info, I am redirected to
http://thewordnerd.myopenid.com, the identity to which thewordnerd.info
delegates. That is, I'm redirected to the exact identity URL, not to an
authorization link.

I am successfully using thewordnerd.info as my identity on many sites, so I
know the delegation is pretty standard. It's stock WordPress with the
delegation plugin. I also just attempted registration on http://identi.ca
and successfully exchanged sreg data. So it seems like something is broken
when using a delegate specifically with ikiwiki, and while I can use
thewordnerd.myopenid.com, I'd rather use my delegate and free myself to
switch to other providers in the future.
