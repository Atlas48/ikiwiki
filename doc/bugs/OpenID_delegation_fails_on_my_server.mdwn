When I use my OpenID, http://thewordnerd.info, I am redirected to
http://thewordnerd.myopenid.com, the identity to which thewordnerd.info
delegates. That is, I'm redirected to the exact identity URL, not to an
authorization link.

I am successfully using thewordnerd.info as my identity on many sites, so I
know the delegation is pretty standard. It's stock WordPress with the
delegation plugin. I also just attempted registration on http://identi.ca
and successfully exchanged sreg data. So it seems like something is broken
when using a delegate specifically with ikiwiki, and while I can use
thewordnerd.myopenid.com, I'd rather use my delegate and free myself to
switch to other providers in the future.

Sorry, didn't notice this edit. But, no, that is incorrect. Entering http://thewordnerd.info or thewordnerd.info should do the exact same thing that entering http://thewordnerd.myopenid.com does--in your case, prompt you to log in, in mine, ask if I want to verify the request. It's redirecting to the page itself, not using it as an OpenID provider.

Unfortunately I don't speak or understand enough Perl to fix this, nor do I understand how to use its debugger, but it looks as if the consumer should support delegation. Not sure why it's behaving incorrectly here.
