I'd like to run ikiwiki under cygwin.  I'm new to ikiwiki and have tried to follow the setup tutorial as best I could.  I got all the way up to step 7, but I can't get the CGI to run successfully (step 8).

After editing ikiwiki.setup, and running "ikiwiki --setup", the CGI script is successfully created.  However, if I then click on "Edit Page" link, I see nothing in the browser and the following in the logs:

Can anyone decipher this for me?  I spent some time with cpan earlier today downloading the latest version I could find of prerequisite modules such as HTML::Template and CGI::FormBuilder.
