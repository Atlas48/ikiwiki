When an enumeration contains entries starting with ordinal numbers, e.g., for lists of meeting dates, ikiwiki turns them all into the 1st.

Testcase:

*The following lists should read: 1. January, 27. March, 99. November, 42. April*
**But instead it reads:**

* 1. January
* 27. March
* 99. November
* 42. April

> That's a consequence of Markdown syntax. The syntax for ordered lists
> (HTML `<ol>`) in Markdown is to use arbitrary numeric prefixes in that style,
> so your text gets parsed as:
>
>     <ul>
>         <li>
>             <ol>
>                 <li>January</li>
>             </ol>
>         </li>
>         ...
>
> You can avoid that interpretation by escaping the dot with a backslash
> (`1\. January`) like so:
>
> * 1\. January
> * 27\. March
>
> or by writing "1st January" and so on. --[[smcv]]
