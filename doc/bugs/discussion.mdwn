Related to using --cgi on command-line. The man page should just be more clear. ikiwiki-1.35 has: "Enable  CGI  mode. ..." To me this implies that is configuring something that will enable CGI mode. If I understand it correctly, it should say "Run ikiwiki as a CGI. Normally this is used from the ikiwiki.cgi CGI wrapper. ..."
