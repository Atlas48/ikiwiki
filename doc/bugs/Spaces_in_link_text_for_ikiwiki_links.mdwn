Versions 2.0 and 2.1 of ikiwiki, and I think earlier versions as well, allowed wiki links to have spaces in the link text. For example, [[ikiwiki logo page|logo]] should create an anchor tag referencing the logo page, and [[ikiwiki logo|logo/ikiwiki.png]] should create an image tag referencing the logo.

As of version 2.2, this no longer works. I think the pattern \\[[...|...]] should allow spaces before the pipe. I suspect this is the same problem as reported in [[index/discussion#index11h1]].
