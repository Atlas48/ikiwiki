Given an uploaded image via: \[\[!img NAME.svg alt="image"\]\]

Viewing the generated page shows the following error:

"\[\[!img Error: failed to read name.svg: Exception 420: no decode delegate for this image format `/home/user/path/name.svg' @ error/svg.c/ReadSVGImage/2815\]\]"

The caps in the image title were somehow converted to small letters, perhaps causing the above error -- no -- I get the same error even when image names are small letters.

The error also occurs with png images.  

How do I to fix this?
