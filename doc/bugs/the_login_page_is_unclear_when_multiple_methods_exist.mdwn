When multiple login methods are enabled, the ikiwiki login page lists one form per method, e.g.

 * one for openid
 * one for local user/password store

Followed by the "login" button underneath. It's not obvious to anyone unfamiliar with the software that these are distinct forms, or that there are multiple ways of logging in, etc. -- [[Jon]]
