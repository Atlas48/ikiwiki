I have a strange problem with editing any page after its first SVN commit.
I'm not sure whether it's my ikiwiki backport bug or my misunderstanding
how ikiwiki works.

Assume that I have Foo page with any content and I want to put there link
to Bar page and next create the page. I do following steps:

1. Click Edit link on Foo page

2. Put the link to Bar page there and commit it by clicking "Save Page"
  button

  The Bar page is rendered correctly and now I can see ?Bar link. The URL
  in the address bar of my browser is

  http://my.host.com/wiki/foo.html?updated

3. Click ?Bar link

  Now I can see textarea for editing of page. It's empty, of course.

  The page doesn't exists in my SVN repo yet and my Apache server knows
  noting about it:

        $ find /my/ikiwiki/src/dir/ -type f -name bar.mdwn
        $ find /my/ikiwiki/dst/dir/ -type f -name bar.html

4. Add some initial content and click "Save Page" button
  to commit changes

  The Foo page also is rendered correctly and now I can see what I wrote.
  The URL in the address bar of my browser is

  http://my.host.com/wiki/bar.html?updated

  The page was added to the SVN repo and my Apache is able to serve it now:

        $ find /my/ikiwiki/src/dir/ -type f -name bar.mdwn
        /my/ikiwiki/src/dir/bar.mdwn
        $ find /my/ikiwiki/dst/dir/ -type f -name bar.html
        /my/ikiwiki/dst/dir/bar.html

5. Change the content of Bar page by clicking Edit link

  I can't do it, because the textarea is empty again. I have to run
  `ikiwiki --setup ikiwiki.setup` command by hand to rebuild the page.
  Then I can edit it.

Where is my mistake?
