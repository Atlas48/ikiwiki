If you use the rescaling feature of the directive [[ikiwiki/directive/img/]] with a smaller image it will distort. E.g. an image with 150x250 rescaled into size=200x200. --bastla

> More specifically: `img` normally preserves aspect ratio:
> `size=200x200` normally means "as large as possible, keeping
