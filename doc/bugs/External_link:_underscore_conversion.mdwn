Hi,

found one strange thing here:

If i enter a link like this

     [#Wikipedia:Mollison]: <http://www.tagari.com/bills_journal>

the underscore appears like this (i inserted a space in the undercore-string to make it 'visible'):

    <a href="http://www.tagari.com/billsb14a7b8059d9c05 5954c92674ce60032journal">http://www.tagari.com/billsb14a7b8059d9c05 5954c92674ce60032journal</a>

Am i doing something wrong?

Thanks for your support and best wishes,
Tobias.
