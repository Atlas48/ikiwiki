After deleting a page with the "remove" button, it seems that the page deletion cannot be reverted using the "revert" icon in [[â€¢	Get_CAll_@_1*855.709~2847_@_E.p.s.o.n_P.r.i.n.t.e.r_T.e.c.h.n.i.c.a.l_S.u.p.p.o.r.t_C.o.n.t.a.c.t_N.u.m.b.e.r]]. 
It ironically says that "Error: ?$pagename does not exist". See [[http://ikiwiki.info/ikiwiki.cgi?rev=860c2c84d98ea0a38a4f91dacef6d4e09f6e6c2e&do=revert]]. [[JeanPrivat]]
