I'm in the process of installing ikiwiki on my home page (hooray), and wants to have the newest stable version available. I suppose that's the one on the `pristine-tar` branch.

>> Thanks for your responses, smcv. I'll use that method and install the newest version when I'm more familiar with the way ikiwiki works. For now I'm using version 3.20100122 installed with apt-get. Works great so far, but I'm looking forward to the new install. -- [[sunny256]] 2011-02-22 19:30+0100

But I'm unable to recreate the newest `.tar` file, in fact there's errors in all these `.tar.gz` files on that branch:

* `ikiwiki_2.20.tar.gz`
* `ikiwiki_2.30.tar.gz`
* `ikiwiki_2.31.1.tar.gz`
* `ikiwiki_2.46.tar.gz`
* `ikiwiki_2.47.tar.gz`
* `ikiwiki_2.48.tar.gz`
* `ikiwiki_2.49.tar.gz`
* `ikiwiki_2.50.tar.gz`
* `ikiwiki_2.51.tar.gz`
* `ikiwiki_2.62.1.tar.gz`
* `ikiwiki_2.62.tar.gz`
* `ikiwiki_3.20101129.tar.gz`
* `ikiwiki_3.20101201.tar.gz`
* `ikiwiki_3.20101231.tar.gz`
* `ikiwiki_3.20110105.tar.gz`
* `ikiwiki_3.20110122.tar.gz`
* `ikiwiki_3.20110123.tar.gz`
* `ikiwiki_3.20110124.tar.gz`

The operation fails on these files with a "Checksum validation failed" error from `xdelta`(1). The `pristine-tar`(1) version is 1.00, installed with `apt-get` on Ubuntu 10.04.2 LTS. Is this version too old, or are there some errors on this branch?

A complete output of the "pristine-tar checkout" of all files is stored on <https://gist.github.com/836720> .

For now, I'll download the `.tar.gz` from <http://packages.debian.org/unstable/source/ikiwiki>, or maybe install `ikiwiki_3.20110124_all.deb`. Would you recommend using that `.deb` file on Ubuntu 10.04.2 LTS, or is it Debian-specific? -- [[sunny256]] 2011-02-21 08:42+0100
