Say you are commenting on this report. The Navbar on top will look like

[ikiwiki](http://ikiwiki.info/)/ [bugs](http://ikiwiki.info/bugs/)/ commenting on Navbar does not link to page being commented on while commenting

while either of those two options would be better:

[ikiwiki](http://ikiwiki.info/)/ [bugs](http://ikiwiki.info/bugs/)/ commenting on [Navbar does not link to page being commented on while commenting](a)

[ikiwiki](http://ikiwiki.info/)/ [bugs](http://ikiwiki.info/bugs/)/ [Navbar does not link to page being commented on while commenting](a) / New comment
