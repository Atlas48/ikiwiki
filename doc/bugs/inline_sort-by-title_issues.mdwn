The [[plugins/inline]] plugin has a `sort="title"` option that causes the pages in the list to be sorted by title rather than creation time.  The [[plugins]] list on this wiki was recently changed to use this option.  If you look at the plugin page, you'll notice that it doesn't look correctly sorted.  e.g. `attach (third party plugin)` falls between `conditional` and `default content for *copyright* and *license*`.

I think the problem here is that the pages are being sorted by their path, whereas only the basename is displayed.  This makes the example above:

 * plugins/conditional
 * plugins/contrib/attach
 * plugins/contrib/default content for *copyright* and *license*

and now you can see why it is ordered that way, and why later on we get:

 * plugins/contrib/unixauth (third party plugin)
 * plugins/creole

which appears to list `unixauth` before `creole`.

I'm not sure what the best fix is.  One fix would be to add another sort option, `sort="path"`, that would use the current (broken) sort by title.  Then add a true `sort="title"` that actually sorts on the title.  It might also be interesting to modify the sort=path to actually list the full path in the links - that way it would be obvious how it is sorted.  Or you could ignore the idea for `sort="path"`, and tell people to use [[plugins/map]] for that.
