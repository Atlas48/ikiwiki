I'm using the tags plugin with tagbase="tags".

Already existing tags, corresponding to pages like tags/foo.html work just fine.

If I add to a page a tag which is not existing (e.g. with [[tag newtag]]) the just modified page will have a link which point to tags/newtag. This is in theory correct, but in practice leads to creating a tags/newtag subpage of the page I'm editing, while my tagbase is supposed to be relative to the wiki root.

When used in a wiki which already have some tags this leads to mixing up tags located in tags/ and tags located in whatever/tags/.
