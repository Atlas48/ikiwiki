I built ikiwiki using

% perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/ed
% make
% make install

This installs the files under /home/ed, for example one of the lines it prints is

cp -a basewiki/* /home/ed/share/ikiwiki/basewiki

However when I try to run ikiwiki I get an error as follows:

% ikiwiki --verbose ~/wikiwc/ ~/public_html/wiki/ --url=http://membled.com/wiki/ 
Can't stat /usr/share/ikiwiki/basewiki: No such file or directory 
 at /home/ed/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.7/IkiWiki/Render.pm line 349 

The PREFIX specified at build time should also affect the share directory -
it shouldn't try to use /usr/share here.

	Actually, the PREFIX, no matter where you specify it, is only
	intended to control where files are _installed_, not where they're
	looked for at runtime.

	There's a good reason not to make PREFIX be used to actually
	change the program's behavior: Most packaging systems use PREFIX
	when building the package, to make it install into a temporary
	directory which gets packaged up.

	It would probably be nice if ikiwiki offered a separate build-time
	setting to control where it looked for its data files, though it already
	offers a way to do it at runtime (--underlaydir and --templatedir).
