I built ikiwiki using

% perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/ed
% make
% make install

This installs the files under /home/ed, for example one of the lines it prints is

cp -a basewiki/* /home/ed/share/ikiwiki/basewiki

However when I try to run ikiwiki I get an error as follows:

% ikiwiki --verbose ~/wikiwc/ ~/public_html/wiki/ --url=http://membled.com/wiki/ 
Can't stat /usr/share/ikiwiki/basewiki: No such file or directory 
 at /home/ed/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.7/IkiWiki/Render.pm line 349 

The PREFIX specified at build time should also affect the share directory - it shouldn't try to use /usr/share here.
