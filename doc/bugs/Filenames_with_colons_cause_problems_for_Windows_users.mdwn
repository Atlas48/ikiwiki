(Note: feel free to say "not a bug" or offer a workaround rather than changing ikiwiki.)

As reported by a Windows user trying ikiwiki: because Windows doesn't support filenames with colons, he couldn't check out the ikiwiki svn repository.  More generally, ikiwiki doesn't encode colons in filenames for wiki pages, but to support Windows users perhaps it should.

Windows does not support filenames containing any of these characters: `/ \ * : ? " < > |`
