I have a commit doing

    -\[[map pages="link(tag/<TMPL_VAR name>) and !papers/*"]]
    +\[[map pages="link(sourcepage()) and !papers/*"]]

ikiwiki now fails to compile the site, barfing:

    Use of uninitialized value in subroutine entry at /usr/share/perl5/IkiWiki.pm line 1288.
    ikiwiki.setup: Can't use string ("") as a subroutine ref while "strict refs" in use at /usr/share/perl5/IkiWiki.pm line 1288.
    BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at (eval 6) line 200.

after forcefully entering the Perl mode of thinking, I reduced this to line
1285 of IkiWiki.pm (2.53), which apparently returns `undef`:

    my $sub=pagespec_translate($spec);

Why does it even bother parsing the diffs of `recentchanges`?

I have not recompiled this site in ages, so I am not sure when this problem
was introduced, but it wasn't there when I worked on the site last about
a year ago in September 2007.
