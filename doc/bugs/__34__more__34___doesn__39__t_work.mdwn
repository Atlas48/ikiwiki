As one can see at [[plugins/more/discussion]], the [[plugins/more]] plugin doesn't work --- it renders as:

    <p><a name="more"></a></p>
    
    <p>This is the rest of my post. Not intended for people catching up on
    their blogs at 30,000 feet. Because I like to make things
    difficult.</p>

No way to toggle visibility.
