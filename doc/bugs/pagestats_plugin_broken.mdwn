Since at least version 2.0 (and certainly a few version before), it seems that the pagestats plugin is broken : each matched page has a count of 2.
This is also (of course) producing flat tag cloud.

My perl knowledge is very limited, but the call :

    my @bl = IkiWiki::backlinks($page);
    $counts{$page} = scalar(@bl);

return allways 2, which seems to me "obvious", because the backlinks() function is returning two array of links...

Did I forget something ?
