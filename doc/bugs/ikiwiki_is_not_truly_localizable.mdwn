A lot of strings in ikiwiki are hardcoded and not taken for locales resources through gettext. This is bad because ikiwiki is thus difficult to spread for non-english users.

I mean that, for instance in CGI.pm, line like:

`my @buttons=("Save Page", "Preview", "Cancel");`

should be written as

`my @buttons=(gettext("Save Page"), gettext("Preview"), gettext("Cancel"));`

In standards templates things seems wrongly written too. For instance in page.tmpl line like:

`<li><a href="<TMPL_VAR EDITURL>" rel="nofollow">Edit</a></li>`

should be written as

`<li><a href="<TMPL_VAR EDITURL>" rel="nofollow"><TMPL_VAR EDITURL_TEXT</a></li>`

with EDITURL_TEXT variable initialized in Render.pm through a gettext call. 

Am I wrong ?

If not I can spend some time preparing patch for such correction if it can help.
