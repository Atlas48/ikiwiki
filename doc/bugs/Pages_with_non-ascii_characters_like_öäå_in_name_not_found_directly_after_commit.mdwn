At least my setup on kapsi.fi always prints 404 Not Found after adding a page with non-ascii characters in name. But the page exists and is visible after the 404 with url encoding and the blog page is inlined correctly on the feed page.

Apparently ikiwiki.info does not complain with 404. Should the character encoding be set in wiki config?
