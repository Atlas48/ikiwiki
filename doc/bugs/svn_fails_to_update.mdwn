In poking around at the svn backend I found that the svn post-commit 
hook calls to svn update fail regularly with an error code of 256. 
Apparently during the post-commit hook can't update because the 
working copy is locked from the commit. Since the post-commit hook doesn't send
errors anywhere and svn update runs with --quiet anyhow, this error
isn't usually visible, but on my system:

    ethan@sundance:~/tests/webtemplates/ikiwiki3/wc$ svn commit -m "Blah.."
    Sending        index.mdwn
    Transmitting file data .
    Committed revision 3.

    #verifying output was created
    ethan@sundance:~/tests/webtemplates/ikiwiki3/wc$ less ../dest/index.html 

    ethan@sundance:~/tests/webtemplates/ikiwiki3/wc$ svn info

A sample error message (obtained through file redirection) is:

    svn: Working copy '.' locked
    svn: run 'svn cleanup' to remove locks (type 'svn help cleanup' for details)

Did I do something stupid again or is this the case on your system too?

Additional note: this doesn't happen when performing svn commits from another wc, 
but *does* happen when committing from the web.
