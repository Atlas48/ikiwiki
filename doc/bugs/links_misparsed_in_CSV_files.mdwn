If a link inside a CSV file contains two or more underscores (\_), then it will get mis-parsed by the table plugin.

e.g. \[[single\_track\_lines]] becomes "em>lines".

Links with only one underscore are OK.

Update 2008-11-24: The problem only occurs if the CSV data is in an external file. If I load it using data="""...""" then it works fine.
