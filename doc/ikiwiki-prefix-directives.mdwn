# NAME

ikiwiki-prefix-directives - convert ikiwiki pages to prefixed directive syntax

# SYNOPSIS

ikiwiki-prefix-directives page.mdwn...

# DESCRIPTION

`ikiwiki-prefix-directives` converts an ikiwiki page from the old
preprocessor directive syntax, requiring a space, to the new syntax,
prefixed by '!'.

Preprocessor directives which already use the new syntax will remain
unchanged.

Note that if the page contains wiki links with spaces, which some
older versions of ikiwiki accepted, ikiwiki-prefix-directives will
treat these as preprocessor directives and convert them.
