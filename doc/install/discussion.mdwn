I am trying to install Ikiwiki version 2.1 from the source tarball.

It has all gone fairly smoothly until I try and run 'make'.

I.e. I have downloaded and unpacked ikiwiki_2.1.tar.gz and have run

    perl Makefile.PL

... which has run OK.


However when I then run 'make' I get:-

    LANG=C perl -I.  -T ikiwiki.out doc html --templatedir=templates \
                    --underlaydir=basewiki --nousedirs\
                    --wikiname="ikiwiki" --verbose \
                    --exclude=/discussion --no-discussion --userdir=users \
                    --plugin=goodstuff \
                    --plugin=haiku --plugin=polygen --plugin=fortune
    Failed to load plugin IkiWiki::Plugin::mdwn: IkiWiki version 2 required--this is only version 1.01 at IkiWiki/Plugin/mdwn.pm line 7.
    BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at IkiWiki/Plugin/mdwn.pm line 7.
    Compilation failed in require at (eval 4) line 2.
    BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at (eval 4) line 2.

    make: *** [extra_build] Error 1
 
How do I fix this?  There may be a bit of old ikiwiki left behind because
I did once have an older version installed but I thought I had removed all
traces of it.

Well I have searched around and there really is nothing left that I can see.

I have removed *everything* found by 'find' and 'locate' that contains 'ikiwiki' except the tar file
and started from the beginning again and I see exactly the same error.

Is it that I maybe have a too old version of some of the Perl dependencies?  The only mdwn.pm files
that I have are the two I have just extracted from the new tar file.  There is *no* ./IkiWiki.pm file

so what/where is it loading to satisfy the ....... aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!

I wasn't noticing the case of the filename, I'd missed the upper case W and guess what 'find' shows me:-

    /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.8/IkiWiki.pm

Removing the above file has fixed my basic problem, now I'm getting lots of (non-fatal) errors
about "Can't locate Locale/gettext.pm", presumably that's a missing Perl module, I can probably
sort that out.


## Errors when running 'make test'

OK, I've now got it to compile and install and presumably it's basically working.  However there
are a few errors when I run 'make test'.  Several errors have disappeared by installing more Perl
stuff (specifically XML::SAX) 

> XML::SAX is a requirement of XML::Simple, which is a documented build
> requirement. (Only really needed if you'll be using subversion actually).

and one error disappeared when I did a 'make install', i.e. the 'make
test' has a test which requires IkiWiki to be installed first.

However I'm still getting the following error in 'make test':-

	t/pagename.................ok

home$ perl -v

This is perl, v5.8.8 built for i486-linux

## Installation in a non-root enviroment
I had a pretty hellacious time installing Ikiwiki (largely due to problems
in Perl) and documented them in [[tips/SharedHosting]].  I'd like to get feedback on the doc and also know if I should file a few bugs to make the installation process a little friendlier to non-root folks.  Thanks for the great app!


## Typing error?

[..] Mail::Sendmail, TimeDate, RPC::XML, [..]: should be DateTime? --[[vibrog]]

> No, TimeDate and DateTime are two different CPAN modules. Ikiwiki uses
