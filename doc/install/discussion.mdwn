I am trying to install Ikiwiki version 2.1 from the source tarball.

It has all gone fairly smoothly until I try and run 'make'.

I.e. I have downloaded and unpacked ikiwiki_2.1.tar.gz and have run

    perl Makefile.PL

... which has run OK.


However when I then run 'make' I get:-

    LANG=C perl -I.  -T ikiwiki.out doc html --templatedir=templates \
                    --underlaydir=basewiki --nousedirs\
                    --wikiname="ikiwiki" --verbose \
                    --exclude=/discussion --no-discussion --userdir=users \
                    --plugin=goodstuff \
                    --plugin=haiku --plugin=polygen --plugin=fortune
    Failed to load plugin IkiWiki::Plugin::mdwn: IkiWiki version 2 required--this is only version 1.01 at IkiWiki/Plugin/mdwn.pm line 7.
    BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at IkiWiki/Plugin/mdwn.pm line 7.
    Compilation failed in require at (eval 4) line 2.
    BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at (eval 4) line 2.

    make: *** [extra_build] Error 1
 
How do I fix this?  There may be a bit of old ikiwiki left behind because
I did once have an older version installed but I thought I had removed all
traces of it.
